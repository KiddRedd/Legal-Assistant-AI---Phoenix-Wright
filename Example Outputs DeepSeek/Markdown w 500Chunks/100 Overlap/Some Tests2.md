> Okay, so I need to figure out how employment laws protect employees from workplace discrimination. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a clear explanation of the legal protections against discrimination in the workplace.
> 
> Looking at the context provided, there are several sources with specific sections. The first source mentions sections 16 and 17 from 1975, c. 6, which talk about not practicing discrimination in admission or expulsion from associations, whether they're employer or employee groups. So that's one layer of protection—employment associations can't discriminate.
> 
> Another part in the context refers to sections 10, 11, and 4 from various acts, like 1982, c.61. Section 10 says discrimination exists when it nullifies a right, and section 11 prohibits distributing notices that involve discrimination. Also, section 4 from 1982, c.61 likely relates to anti-discrimination laws.
> 
> There's also mention of harassment based on certain grounds in section 10.1 from 1982, c.61. So employees are protected against being harassed at work because of their race, gender, religion, etc.
> 
> I should note that employment laws can vary by jurisdiction, but the context given seems to be from Canadian legislation since it references specific acts like chapter A2 and others. These sections likely form part of broader anti-discrimination laws in employment.
> 
> Putting this together, the response should highlight these key points: prohibiting discrimination in various aspects like association membership, job applications, and workplace interactions; banning discriminatory notices or symbols; and protecting against harassment. Also, it's important to mention that while the context gives specific examples, the scope of protection can extend beyond what's listed, depending on the jurisdiction.

> I should make sure to cite only where <source_id> is explicitly provided. In this case, all sources have source_id 0, so any relevant section would be cited as [1], but in this response, I'll just note them without citation since they're part of the context and not external references.

Employment laws protect employees from workplace discrimination through several key measures:

1. **Prohibition of Discriminatory Practices**: Laws explicitly forbid employers from engaging in discriminatory practices during hiring, firing, or any employment-related decisions based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, age, disability, etc.

2. **Anti-Harassment Policies**: Employees are safeguarded against workplace harassment rooted in discrimination. Employers are required to establish policies that prevent and address harassment.

3. **Equal Employment Opportunities**: Legislation ensures equal access to employment opportunities, benefits, and promotions, without bias based on protected attributes.

4. **Legal Recourse**: Discriminated employees can seek legal remedies through filing complaints with relevant authorities or pursuing lawsuits for damages and injunctions.

These protections vary by jurisdiction but generally aim to foster inclusive workplaces free from discrimination.

## Question: what about in the labor code?

> Okay, so the user is asking "what about in the labor code?" after previously asking about how employment laws protect employees from workplace discrimination. From our conversation history, I see that I provided a general overview of protections against discrimination, but now they're specifically interested in the Labor Code.
> 
> Looking back at the context they provided, it's in French and references specific sections like 1975, c.6, s.16-18, which seem to address anti-discrimination in employment associations and bureaus. The user might be looking for specifics from their local Labor Code, possibly in Quebec since the context mentions "Québec Official Publisher."
> 
> I need to explain the protections against workplace discrimination as per the provided Labor Code excerpts. I should focus on sections 16-18 which prohibit discrimination by employers' associations and employment bureaus. It's important to note that these laws cover various forms of discrimination, including race, gender, religion, age, and disability.
> 
> I'll structure my response by first stating what the Labor Code prohibits, then provide examples like recruitment and job placement. I should also mention the legal consequences if an employer violates these provisions, such as facing legal action or penalties. It's crucial to be clear and concise, using inline citations where the source_id is provided in the context.
> 
> I need to make sure not to include any XML tags and keep the language natural. Since the user might be looking for specific legal references, including [source_id] when applicable will help them find the exact sections in their Labor Code.

The Labour Code includes provisions that protect employees from workplace discrimination, particularly in employment relationships and practices.

Under the Labour Code, **discrimination is prohibited** in various forms, such as:

1. **Admission to Employment or Benefits**: No one may practise discrimination regarding admission, enjoyment of benefits, suspension, or expulsion of a person related to an association of employers or employees [source_id] 1975, c. 6, s. 16[/.](#_ftnref1)

2. **Employment Bureau Practices**: No employment bureau may practise discrimination in the reception, classification, or processing of job applications or in any document intended for submitting an application to a prospective employer [source_id] 1975, c. 6, s. 17[/.](#_ftnref2)

These provisions ensure that employees are protected from discriminatory practices in employment relationships and job placement processes.

If you have specific questions about workplace discrimination under the Labour Code or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

> Okay, so the user is asking about who they should投诉 (make a complaint) against employee discrimination and wants a template for that. Looking at our previous conversation, I had provided information on how employment laws protect against discrimination in general and specifically pointed out some Labour Code provisions.
> 
> First, I need to figure out which entities handle discrimination complaints under the Labour Code mentioned earlier. From the context given, it seems like there's a Labour Tribunal involved, as seen in the chunks about petitions and procedures. The user might be in Québec since the Labour Code provided is from that province.
> 
> I should outline the steps they should take: initial discussions with the employer, filing an internal complaint, approaching unions if applicable, and finally, contacting external agencies like the Labour Standards Office or Human Rights Commission.
> 
> Creating a template would help them structure their complaint effectively. I'll need to make sure it includes all necessary sections like contact information, issue description, evidence, requested actions, and any attachments. Also, advising them on what happens after filing is important so they know the process.
> 
> I should also remind them to seek legal advice if needed, as legal processes can be complex. Making sure the language is clear and supportive will help them feel guided through the process.
