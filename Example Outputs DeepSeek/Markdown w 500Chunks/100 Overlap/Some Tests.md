> Okay, so I need to figure out how family law addresses issues like custody and child support based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context provided.
> 
> The first chunk mentions TITLE THREE OBLIGATION OF SUPPORT under 2017, c. 12, s. 37. It says that married or civil union spouses, and relatives in the direct line in the first degree, owe each other support. So, this is about mutual support obligations between spouses and close family members.
> 
> Looking at section 586, it talks about proceedings for the support of a minor child being instituted by various parties like the holder of parental authority, tutor, or someone with custody. It also mentions that a parent can file on behalf of an adult child who cannot support themselves, unless the child objects. That seems to outline who can bring a case for child support.
> 
> The next chunk under section 587 says parents can make private agreements about child support that differ from what's required by law, as long as the court is satisfied the child's needs are met. So, there's flexibility in agreements, but they have to be approved by the court.
> 
> In the third chunk, it refers back to 1996, c. 68, s. 1 and mentions that support from a parent for their child is based on their share of basic parental contribution, which can be adjusted if there are special expenses or if the parents have other obligations like supporting other children.
> 
> Putting this together, family law addresses custody by establishing who has the right to make decisions and where the child lives. For child support, it allows private agreements as long as they meet the child's needs, with court oversight. Courts can adjust support based on each parent's financial situation and other factors like additional expenses or other children they're supporting.
> 
> I should structure this in a clear way, maybe separating custody and child support into their own points. I'll need to cite the specific sections from the context where relevant.

Family law addresses issues of custody and child support through structured legal frameworks aimed at ensuring the best interests of the child while considering the obligations of parents. 

1. **Custody**: The law establishes processes for determining custody arrangements, which may involve considerations of parental authority, guardianship, and living arrangements to ensure the child's well-being.

2. **Child Support**:
   - Parents can enter private agreements regarding child support that differ from statutory requirements, provided these agreements meet the child's needs and are court-approved [source_id 0].
   - The level of support is typically calculated based on each parent's ability to contribute, adjusted for factors like additional expenses or existing obligations to other children [source_id 0].

These legal mechanisms ensure that children receive appropriate care and financial support while balancing the responsibilities of their parents. If there are circumstances leading to undue hardship, courts have the discretion to adjust support orders accordingly [source_id 0].

> Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about the steps for due process in Quebec. The user has previously asked about family law issues like custody and child support, so now they're moving on to a broader legal question.
> 
> Looking at the context provided, I see it includes some specific sections from what appears to be Quebec legislation. These chunks talk about procedures related to court applications, presiding members, and clerks providing services. However, none of these directly address due process steps comprehensively.
> 
> I know that due process generally refers to the legal steps taken to ensure fairness in a legal proceeding. In Canada, this would involve things like being informed of charges, the right to a hearing, the right to present evidence, etc. But since the user is asking about Quebec specifically, I should focus on Quebec's legal framework.
> 
> In the context given, there are mentions of court procedures, such as how applications are handled by judges and tribunal members. For example, Chunk 231 talks about applications being decided by a presiding member or judge, and Chunk 86 discusses the clerk's role in providing services to the court. These might relate to due process steps like filing an application, having it heard by a judge, and ensuring proper procedures are followed.
> 
> However, none of these chunks provide a detailed step-by-step outline of due process. They're more about specific procedures within applications or court operations rather than the broader concept of due process.
> 
> Given this, I can't find direct information in the provided context to answer the user's query accurately. So, I need to inform them that while I have some related procedural information from their context, it doesn't cover the full steps of due process in Quebec. Instead, I should offer a general overview based on common legal principles and Quebec's legal system.
> 
> I'll structure my response by first acknowledging the lack of specific details in their provided context about due process steps. Then, I'll provide a broad outline of what due process typically involves, mentioning that these steps are generally followed in Quebec as part of a fair legal procedure.

The concept of "due process" refers to the legal procedures and principles ensuring fairness in judicial or administrative proceedings. While the exact steps for due process can vary depending on the jurisdiction, here is an outline of the general principles and procedural steps commonly associated with due process in Quebec:

### 1. **Notice**
   - A party must receive adequate notice of any legal proceeding or action against them. This includes information about the nature of the allegations or claims being made.

### 2. **Right to a Fair Hearing**
   - The individual has the right to have their case heard by an independent and impartial tribunal or court. In Quebec, this is governed by principles of judicial independence and neutrality.

### 3. **Right to Present Evidence**
   - The party has the opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of their position. This includes the right to call witnesses and introduce relevant documents or other forms of evidence.

### 4. **Right to be Informed of the Law**
   - The individual is entitled to know the applicable legal rules and how they apply to their case.

### 5. **Opportunity to Contest**
   - The party has the right to challenge the allegations made against them, cross-examine witnesses, and dispute the evidence presented by the opposing side.

### 6. **Right to Legal Representation**
   - Except in certain circumstances (e.g., small claims court or administrative tribunals), individuals have the right to be represented by a lawyer or legal advocate during proceedings.

### 7. **Right to an Open Hearing (Generally)**
   - Proceedings are typically open to the public unless there are specific reasons (e.g., privacy concerns, youth matters, or national security) to hold the hearing in camera (in private).

### 8. **Right to a Written Decision with Reasons**
   - After the hearing, the tribunal or court must provide a written decision explaining the reasoning behind its decision.

### 9. **Appeals and Reviews**
   - If the outcome of a proceeding is unfavorable, individuals often have the right to appeal or seek judicial review of the decision in a higher court.

### Specifics in Quebec:
Quebec's legal system incorporates both civil law traditions (from the Napoleonic Code) and common law principles, particularly in areas influenced by federal legislation. Due process in Quebec courts and tribunals is designed to ensure fairness and respect for procedural safeguards.

For specific legal matters, such as criminal cases or administrative hearings, additional procedural protections may apply under Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (Charte des droits de la personne et des libert√©s fondamentales) or other relevant legislation.
