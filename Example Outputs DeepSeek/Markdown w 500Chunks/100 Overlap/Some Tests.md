> Okay, so I need to figure out how family law addresses issues like custody and child support based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context provided.
> 
> The first chunk mentions TITLE THREE OBLIGATION OF SUPPORT under 2017, c. 12, s. 37. It says that married or civil union spouses, and relatives in the direct line in the first degree, owe each other support. So, this is about mutual support obligations between spouses and close family members.
> 
> Looking at section 586, it talks about proceedings for the support of a minor child being instituted by various parties like the holder of parental authority, tutor, or someone with custody. It also mentions that a parent can file on behalf of an adult child who cannot support themselves, unless the child objects. That seems to outline who can bring a case for child support.
> 
> The next chunk under section 587 says parents can make private agreements about child support that differ from what's required by law, as long as the court is satisfied the child's needs are met. So, there's flexibility in agreements, but they have to be approved by the court.
> 
> In the third chunk, it refers back to 1996, c. 68, s. 1 and mentions that support from a parent for their child is based on their share of basic parental contribution, which can be adjusted if there are special expenses or if the parents have other obligations like supporting other children.
> 
> Putting this together, family law addresses custody by establishing who has the right to make decisions and where the child lives. For child support, it allows private agreements as long as they meet the child's needs, with court oversight. Courts can adjust support based on each parent's financial situation and other factors like additional expenses or other children they're supporting.
> 
> I should structure this in a clear way, maybe separating custody and child support into their own points. I'll need to cite the specific sections from the context where relevant.

Family law addresses issues of custody and child support through structured legal frameworks aimed at ensuring the best interests of the child while considering the obligations of parents. 

1. **Custody**: The law establishes processes for determining custody arrangements, which may involve considerations of parental authority, guardianship, and living arrangements to ensure the child's well-being.

2. **Child Support**:
   - Parents can enter private agreements regarding child support that differ from statutory requirements, provided these agreements meet the child's needs and are court-approved [source_id 0].
   - The level of support is typically calculated based on each parent's ability to contribute, adjusted for factors like additional expenses or existing obligations to other children [source_id 0].

These legal mechanisms ensure that children receive appropriate care and financial support while balancing the responsibilities of their parents. If there are circumstances leading to undue hardship, courts have the discretion to adjust support orders accordingly [source_id 0].
