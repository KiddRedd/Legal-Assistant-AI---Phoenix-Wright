> Okay, let's figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a link to a section of the Canadian Criminal Code and are asking about its content. The link goes to section 423 of the C-46 Act on the Justice Canada website.
> 
> Looking at my context, I see some sources related to sections 82(1), (2), etc., but nothing directly about section 423. So, since the context doesn't have info on that specific section, I can't use any citations from it. 
> 
> The user is likely looking for a summary or explanation of what section 423 entails. From the link's preview, it mentions "Every one is guilty of an offence...Exception". That sounds like it's related to assault charges with exceptions.
> 
> I should inform them that I can't provide details due to lack of context but suggest they review the linked document for exact information. Maybe offer to help if they have specific questions after reading it.
