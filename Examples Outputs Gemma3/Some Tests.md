I am sorry, but the provided context does not contain the information from the URL you provided. The context appears to be excerpts from various Canadian Acts and related documents, but it doesn's include the content of section 423 of the *Act respecting legal aid*.

Therefore, I am unable to tell you what is on that page.



If you can provide the text from that page, I would be happy to analyze it for you.
