(1) the goods were given to the merchant for repair while they were still under warranty and the merchant
did not provide a replacement free of charge;

the repair of goods leased from the merchant for the use of the services purchased.
2009, c. 51, s. 11.
214.6. The consumer may, at any time and at the consumer’s discretion, cancel the contract by sending a
notice to the merchant. The cancellation takes effect by operation of law on the sending of the notice or the
date specified in the notice.
The total of the charges the merchant may then claim from the consumer, other than the price of the
services provided to the consumer calculated at the rate provided in the contract, constitutes the contract
cancellation indemnity. For the purposes of this paragraph, a service contract or a contract for the lease of
goods concluded on the making of or in consideration of the service contract forms a whole with that contract.

economic inducements were given to him by the merchant, the cancellation indemnity may not exceed the
value of the economic inducements determined by regulation that were given to him. The indemnity decreases
as prescribed by regulation.
When no economic inducement determined by regulation was given to the consumer, the maximum
indemnity the merchant may charge is the lesser of $50 and an amount representing not more than 10% of the
price of the services provided for in the contract that were not supplied.
2009, c. 51, s. 11.
214.8. If the consumer unilaterally cancels an indeterminate-term contract, no cancellation indemnity may
be claimed from the consumer unless the merchant gave the consumer a rebate on all or part of the sales price
of the goods purchased in consideration of the service contract and entitlement to the rebate is acquired
progressively according to the cost of the services used or the time elapsed. In such a case, the cancellation
indemnity may not exceed the amount of the unpaid balance of the sales price of the goods at the time the
contract was made. The indemnity decreases as prescribed by regulation.
2009, c. 51, s. 11.
214.9. If the consumer has paid a security deposit, the merchant may not cancel the contract for failure to
pay outstanding amounts under the contract when they become due for as long as the amounts due do not
exceed the amount of the deposit.
2009, c. 51, s. 11.
214.10. The merchant must notify the consumer in writing on using all or part of the security deposit to
collect amounts not paid when they become due.
2009, c. 51, s. 11.
214.11. The merchant must return the security deposit to the consumer, with interest at the rate determined
by regulation, minus any amounts due under the contract, within 30 days after the date on which the contract
expires if it is not renewed or the date on which the contract is cancelled.
