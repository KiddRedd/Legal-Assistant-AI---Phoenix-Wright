1991, c. 64, a. 1. 2. Every person is the holder of a patrimony. It may be the subject of a division or of an appropriation to a purpose, but only to the extent provided by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2; I. N. 20140501. 3. Every person is the holder of personality rights, such as the right to life, the right to the inviolability and integrity of his person, and the right to the respect of his name, reputation and privacy. These rights are inalienable. 1991, c. 64, a. 3.
### Chunk 76

4. Every person is fully able to exercise his civil rights. In certain cases, the law provides for representation. 1991, c. 64, a. 4; 2020, c. 11, s. 1. 5. Every person exercises his civil rights under the surname and usual given name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth. 1991, c. 64, a. 5; 2022, c. 22, s. 1. 6.

Every person is inviolable and is entitled to the integrity of his person. Except in cases provided for by law, no one may interfere with his person without his free and enlightened consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 10. DIVISION I CARE 11. No one may be made to undergo care of any nature, whether for examination, specimen taking, removal of tissue, treatment or any other act, except with his consent.
### Chunk 79

Except as otherwise provided by law, the consent is subject to no other formal requirement and may be withdrawn at any time, even verbally. If the person concerned is incapable of giving or refusing his consent to care and has not drawn up advance medical directives under the Act respecting endoflife care (chapter S32. 0001) by which he expresses such consent or refusal, a person authorized by law or by a protection mandate may do so in his place. 1991, c. 64, a. 11; I. N. 20151101; 2014, c.
### Chunk 80

2, s. 65; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 12. A person who gives his consent to or refuses care for another person is bound to act in the sole interest of that person, complying, as far as possible, with any wishes the latter may have expressed. If he gives his consent, he shall ensure that the care is beneficial notwithstanding the gravity and permanence of certain of its effects, that it is advisable in the circumstances and that the risks incurred are not disproportionate to the anticipated benefit.
### Chunk 81

1991, c. 64, a. 12; 2014, c. 2, s. 66. 13. Consent to medical care is not required in case of emergency if the life of the person is in danger or his integrity is threatened and his consent cannot be obtained in due time. It is required, however, where the care is unusual or has become useless or where its consequences could be intolerable for the person. 1991, c. 64, a. 13. 14. Consent to care required by the state of health of a minor is given by the person having parental authority or by his tutor.
### Chunk 82

A minor 14 years of age or over, however, may give his consent alone to such care. If his state requires that he remains in a health or social services establishment for over 12 hours, the person having parental authority or tutor shall be informed of that fact. 1991, c. 64, a. 14. 15. Where it is ascertained that a person of full age is incapable of giving consent to care required by his or her state of health and in the absence of advance medical directives, consent is given by his or her mandatary CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 33 of 556 ### Page 34 or tutor.
### Chunk 83

If the person of full age is not so represented, consent is given by his or her married, civil union or de facto spouse or, if the person has no spouse or his or her spouse is prevented from giving consent, it is given by a close relative or a person who shows a special interest in the person of full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 15; 2002, c. 6, s. 1; 2014, c. 2, s. 67; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 16. The authorization of the court is necessary where the person who may give consent to care required by the state of health of a minor or a person of full age who is incapable of giving his consent is prevented from doing so or, without justification, refuses to do so; it is also necessary where a person of full age who is incapable of giving his consent categorically refuses to receive care, except in the case of hygienic care or emergency.
### Chunk 84

The authorization of the court is necessary, furthermore, to submit a minor 14 years of age or over to care which he refuses, except in the case of emergency if his life is in danger or his integrity threatened, in which case the consent of the person having parental authority or the tutor is sufficient. 1991, c. 64, a. 16; I. N. 20140501. 17. A minor 14 years of age or over may give his consent alone to care not required by the state of his health; however, the consent of the person having parental authority or of the tutor is required if the care entails a serious risk for the health of the minor and may cause him grave and permanent effects.
### Chunk 85

1991, c. 64, a. 17. 18. Where the person is under 14 years of age or is incapable of giving his consent, consent to care not required by his state of health is given by the person having parental authority or the mandatary or tutor; the authorization of the court is also necessary if the care entails a serious risk to health or if it may cause grave and permanent effects. 1991, c. 64, a. 18; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 19. A person of full age who is capable of giving his consent may alienate a part of his body inter vivos, provided the risk incurred is not disproportionate to the benefit that may reasonably be anticipated.
### Chunk 86

A minor or a person of full age who is incapable of giving his consent may, with the consent of the person having parental authority, mandatary or tutor and with the authorization of the court, alienate a part of his body only if that part is capable of regeneration and provided that no serious risk to his health results. 1991, c. 64, a. 19; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 20. A person of full age who is capable of giving his consent may participate in research that could interfere with the integrity of his person provided that the risk incurred is not disproportionate to the benefit that can reasonably be anticipated.
### Chunk 87

The research project must be approved and monitored by a research ethics committee. 1991, c. 64, a. 20; 2013, c. 17, s. 1. 21. A minor or a person of full age who is incapable of giving consent may participate in research that could interfere with the integrity of his person only if the risk incurred, taking into account his state of health and personal condition, is not disproportionate to the benefit that may reasonably be anticipated. Moreover, a minor or a person of full age incapable of giving consent may participate in such research only if, where he is the only subject of the research, it has the potential to produce benefit to his health or only if, in the case of research on a group, it has the potential to produce results capable of conferring benefit to other persons in the same age category or having the same disease or handicap.
### Chunk 88

In all cases, a minor or a person of full age incapable of giving consent may not participate in such research where he understands the nature and consequences of the research and objects to participating in it. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 34 of 556 ### Page 35 The research project must be approved and monitored by a competent research ethics committee. Such a committee is formed by the Minister of Health and Social Services or designated by that Minister from among existing research ethics committees; the composition and operating conditions of such a committee are determined by the Minister and published in the Gazette officielle du Québec.
### Chunk 89

Consent to research that could interfere with the integrity of a minor may be given by the person having parental authority or the tutor. A minor 14 years of age or over, however, may give consent alone if, in the opinion of the competent research ethics committee, the research involves only minimal risk and the circumstances justify it. Consent to research that could interfere with the integrity of a person of full age incapable of giving consent may be given by the mandatary or tutor. However, where such a person of full age is not so represented and the research involves only minimal risk, consent may be given by the person qualified to consent to any care required by the state of health of the person of full age.
### Chunk 90

Consent may also be given by such a qualified person where a person of full age suddenly becomes incapable of giving consent and the research, insofar as it must be undertaken promptly after the appearance of the condition giving rise to it, does not permit, for lack of time, the designation of a legal representative for the person of full age. In both cases, it is incumbent upon the competent research ethics committee to determine, when evaluating the research project, whether it meets the prescribed requirements.
### Chunk 91

1991, c. 64, a. 21; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; 1998, c. 32, s. 1; 2013, c. 17, s. 2; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 22. A part of the body, whether an organ, tissue or other substance, removed from a person as part of the care he receives may, with his consent or that of the person qualified to give consent on his behalf, be used for purposes of research or, if he has died, be so used with the consent of the person who could give or could have given consent to any care required by his state of health.
### Chunk 92

1991, c. 64, a. 22; 2013, c. 17, s. 3; I. N. 20140501. 23. When the court is called upon to rule on an application for authorization with respect to care or the alienation of a part of a person’s body, it obtains the opinions of experts, of the person having parental authority, of the mandatary or of the tutor and of the tutorship council; it may also obtain the opinion of any person who shows a special interest in the person concerned by the application. The court is also bound to obtain the opinion of the person concerned unless that is impossible, and to respect his refusal unless the care is required by his state of health.
### Chunk 93

1991, c. 64, a. 23; 1998, c. 32, s. 2; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 24. Consent to care not required by a person’s state of health, to the alienation of a part of a person’s body, or to research that could interfere with the integrity of his person shall be given in writing. However, consent to such research may be given otherwise than in writing if justified in the circumstances in the opinion of a research ethics committee. In such a case, the committee determines the proper manner, for evidential purposes, of obtaining consent.
### Chunk 94

It may be withdrawn at any time, even verbally. 1991, c. 64, a. 24; 2013, c. 17, s. 4. 25. The alienation by a person of a part or product of his body shall be gratuitous; it may not be repeated if it involves a risk to his health. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 35 of 556 ### Page 36 A person’s participation in research that could interfere with the integrity of his person may not give rise to any financial reward other than the payment of an indemnity as compensation for the loss and inconvenience suffered.
### Chunk 95

1991, c. 64, a. 25; 2013, c. 17, s. 5. DIVISION II CONFINEMENT IN AN INSTITUTION AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT 1997, c. 75, s. 28. 26. No one may be confined in a health or social services institution for a psychiatric assessment or following a psychiatric assessment concluding that confinement is necessary, without the person’s consent or without authorization by law or the court. Consent may be given by the person having parental authority or, in the case of a person of full age unable to express his wishes, by his mandatary or tutor.
### Chunk 96

Such consent may be given by the representative only if the person concerned does not object. 1991, c. 64, a. 26; 1997, c. 75, s. 29; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 11, s. 254. 27. Where the court has serious reasons to believe that a person is a danger to himself or to others owing to his mental state, it may, on the application of a physician or an interested person and notwithstanding the absence of consent, order that he be confined temporarily in a health or social services institution for a psychiatric assessment.
### Chunk 97

The court may also, where appropriate, authorize any other medical examination that is necessary in the circumstances. The application, if refused, may not be submitted again except where different facts are alleged. If the danger is grave and immediate, the person may be placed under preventive confinement, without the authorization of the court, as provided for in the Act respecting the protection of persons whose mental state presents a danger to themselves or to others (chapter P38. 001).
### Chunk 98

1991, c. 64, a. 27; 1997, c. 75, s. 30. 28. Where the court orders that a person be placed under confinement for a psychiatric assessment, an examination must be carried out within 24 hours after the person is taken in charge by the institution or, if the person was already under preventive confinement, within 24 hours of the court order. If the physician who carries out the examination concludes that confinement in an institution is necessary, a second psychiatric examination must be carried out by another physician, at the latest within 96 hours after the person is taken in charge by the institution or, if the person was already under preventive confinement, within 48 hours of the court order.
### Chunk 99

As soon as a physician reaches the conclusion that confinement is not necessary, the person must be released. If both physicians reach the conclusion that confinement is necessary, the person may be kept under confinement without his consent or the authorization of the court for no longer than 48 hours. 1991, c. 64, a. 28; 1997, c. 75, s. 31; 2016, c. 4, s. 3. 29. A psychiatric examination report must deal in particular with the necessity of confining the person in an institution if he is a danger to himself or to others owing to his mental state, with the ability of the person who has undergone the examination to care for himself or to administer his property and, where applicable, with the advisability of instituting tutorship to a person of full age, or obtaining homologation of a protection mandate, for him.

Confinement in an institution following a psychiatric assessment may only be authorized by the court if both psychiatric reports conclude that confinement is necessary.
### Chunk 101

Even if that is the case, the court may not authorize confinement unless the court itself has serious reasons to believe that the person is dangerous and that the person’s confinement is necessary, whatever evidence may be otherwise presented to the court and even in the absence of any contrary medical opinion. 1991, c. 64, a. 30; 1997, c. 75, s. 33; 2002, c. 19, s. 1. 30. 1. A judgment authorizing confinement must also set the duration of confinement. However, the person under confinement must be released as soon as confinement is no longer justified, even if the set period of confinement has not elapsed.
### Chunk 102

Any confinement required beyond the duration set by the judgment must be authorized by the court, in accordance with the provisions of article 30. 2002, c. 19, s. 1. 31. Every person confined in and receiving care in a health or social services establishment shall be informed by the establishment of the program of care established for him and of any important change in the program or in his living conditions.

The following acts, in particular, may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person: (1) entering or taking anything in his dwelling; (2) intentionally intercepting or using his private communications; (3) appropriating or using his image or voice while he is in private premises; (4) keeping his private life under observation by any means; (5) using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public; (6) using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.
### Chunk 106

1991, c. 64, a. 36. 37. Every person who establishes a file on another person shall have a serious and legitimate reason for doing so. He may gather only information which is relevant to the stated objective of the file, and may not, without the consent of the person concerned or authorization by law, communicate such information to third persons or use it for purposes that are inconsistent with the purposes for which the file was established. In addition, he may not, when establishing or using the file, otherwise invade the privacy or injure the reputation of the person concerned.
### Chunk 107

1991, c. 64, a. 37; I. N. 20140501. 38. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person may, free of charge, examine and cause the rectification of a file kept on him by another person with a view to making a decision in his regard or to informing a third person; he may also cause a copy of it to be made for a reasonable cost. The information contained in the file shall be made accessible in an intelligible transcript. 1991, c. 64, a. 38; 2016, c. 4, s. 5. 39. A person keeping a file on a person may not deny him access to the information contained therein unless he has a serious and legitimate reason for doing so or unless the information may seriously injure a third person.
### Chunk 108

1991, c. 64, a. 39; I. N. 20140501. 40. Every person may cause information which is contained in a file concerning him and which is inaccurate, incomplete or equivocal to be rectified; he may also cause obsolete information or information not justified by the purpose of the file to be deleted, or deposit his written comments in the file. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 38 of 556 ### Page 39 Notice of the rectification is given without delay to every person having received the information in the preceding six months and, where applicable, to the person who provided that information.
### Chunk 109

The same rule applies to an application for rectification, if it is contested. 1991, c. 64, a. 40. 41. Where the law does not provide the conditions for and manner of exercising the right of examination or rectification of a file, the court, upon application, determines them. Similarly, if a difficulty arises in the exercise of those rights, the court settles it, upon application. 1991, c. 64, a. 41; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER IV RESPECT OF THE BODY AFTER DEATH 42.
### Chunk 110

A person of full age may determine the nature of his funeral and the disposal of his body; a minor may also do so with the written consent of the person having parental authority or his tutor. In the absence of wishes expressed by the deceased, the wishes of the heirs or successors prevail. In both cases, the heirs or successors are bound to act; the expenses are charged to the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 42; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 6. 43. A person of full age or a minor 14 years of age or over may, for medical or scientific purposes, give his body or authorize the removal of organs or tissues therefrom.
### Chunk 111

A minor under 14 years of age may also do so with the consent of the person having parental authority or of his tutor. These wishes are expressed verbally before two witnesses, or in writing, and may be revoked in the same manner. The wishes expressed shall be followed, unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. 1991, c. 64, a. 43; I. N. 20140501. 44. A part of the body of a deceased person may be removed, if the wishes of the deceased are not known or cannot be presumed, with the consent of the person who was or would have been qualified to give consent to care.
### Chunk 112

Consent is not required where two physicians attest in writing to the impossibility of obtaining it in due time, the urgency of the operation and the serious hope of saving a human life or of improving its quality to an appreciable degree. 1991, c. 64, a. 44; I. N. 20140501. 45. No part of the body may be removed before the death of the donor is attested by two physicians who do not participate either in the removal or in the transplantation. 1991, c. 64, a. 45. 46. An autopsy may be performed in the cases provided for by law or if the deceased had already given his consent thereto; it may also be performed with the consent of the person who was or would have been qualified to consent to care.
### Chunk 113

The person requesting the autopsy or having given his consent thereto has a right to receive a copy of the report. 1991, c. 64, a. 46; I. N. 20140501. 47. The court may, if circumstances justify it, order the performance of an autopsy on the deceased at the request of a physician or any interested person; in the latter case, it may restrict the release of parts of the autopsy report. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 39 of 556 ### Page 40 The coroner may also order the performance of an autopsy on the deceased in the cases provided for by law.
### Chunk 114

1991, c. 64, a. 47. 48. No one may embalm, bury or cremate a body before an attestation of death has been drawn up and six hours have elapsed since that was done. 1991, c. 64, a. 48; I. N. 20151101. 49. Subject to compliance with the requirements of the law, it is permissible to disinter a body on the order of a court, on the change of destination of its burial place or in order to bury it elsewhere or to repair the tomb. Disinterment is also permissible on the order of a coroner in accordance with the law.

The name is comprised of the surname and the given names, including the usual given name.
### Chunk 116

That given name is the one commonly used by a person to identify himself and under which his civil rights are exercised. 1991, c. 64, a. 50; 2022, c. 22, s. 5. 51. A child is given, as his father and mother or his parents choose, one to four given names composed of not more than two parts and a surname composed of not more than two parts taken from those which compose his parents’ surnames. If the child is given more than one given name, the parents choose his usual given name from among those given names.
### Chunk 117

1991, c. 64, a. 51; 1999, c. 47, s. 1; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 293; 2022, c. 22, s. 6. 52. In case of disagreement over the choice of a surname, the registrar of civil status assigns to the child a surname consisting of two parts, one part being taken from the surname of his father or of one of the parents and the other from that of his mother or of the other parent, according to their respective choice. If the disagreement is over the choice of a given name or names, the registrar assigns to the child, as the case may be, two or four given names chosen respectively by the father and mother or by the parents.
### Chunk 118

If the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 40 of 556 ### Page 41 disagreement is over the choice of the usual given name, the registrar assigns to the child such a given name from among the given names received. 1991, c. 64, a. 52; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 7. 53. A child whose filiation is established with regard to only his father or his mother or one of his parents bears the surname of his father, mother or parent, as the case may be, and one to four given names chosen by his father, mother or parent, including the usual given name.
### Chunk 119

A child whose filiation is not established bears the name assigned to him by the registrar of civil status. 1991, c. 64, a. 53; 2022, c. 22, s. 294; 2022, c. 22, s. 8. 54. Where the name chosen by the father and mother or by the parents contains an odd compound surname or odd given names which clearly invite ridicule or may discredit the child, the registrar of civil status may suggest to the parents that they change the child’s name. If they refuse to do so, the registrar nevertheless draws up the act of birth and notifies the Attorney General of Québec.
### Chunk 120

The Attorney General may bring the matter before the court within 90 days of the registration of the act to request that the surname of one of the parents be substituted for the surname chosen by the parents or that two given names in common use, including one designated as the usual given name, be substituted for the given names chosen by the parents. Until the time for bringing the matter before the court expires or, if proceedings are brought, until the judgment becomes final, the registrar of civil status makes a notation of the notice given to the Attorney General on every copy, certificate and attestation issued on the basis of the act of birth.
### Chunk 121

1991, c. 64, a. 54; 1999, c. 47, s. 2; 2016, c. 4, s. 7; 2022, c. 22, s. 9. § 2. — Use of name 1991, c. 64, Div. II; 2022, c. 22, s. 10. 55. Every person has a right to the respect of his name. 1991, c. 64, a. 55; 2022, c. 22, s. 11. 56. A person who uses a name other than his or her own is liable for any resulting confusion or injury. The holder of a name as well as his or her spouse or close relatives may object to such use and demand redress for the injury caused.

1991, c. 64, a. 56; 2002, c. 6, s. 2; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 12. § 3. — Substitution of the usual given name 2022, c. 22, s. 13. 56. 1. Another given name stated in the act of birth may be substituted for the usual given name on mere notice in writing presented to the registrar of civil status. A person who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year may be the subject of such a notice. A child under one year of age, born and domiciled in Québec, is considered to have been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.
### Chunk 123

However, the rules governing a change of name apply to any subsequent substitution, with the necessary modifications. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 41 of 556 ### Page 42 The content of the notice, the information and documents that must accompany the notice as well as the duties payable by the person presenting the notice are determined by government regulation. 2022, c. 22, s. 13. 56. 2. A notice of substitution of the usual given name of a minor child may be presented by his tutor or by the minor alone if he is 14 years of age or over.
### Chunk 124

Except for a compelling reason, the usual given name of a minor child is not substituted if, as the case may be, the father and mother or the parents of the minor child as legal tutors, the tutor, if any, or the minor 14 years of age or over, have not been notified of the notice or if one of them objects to the substitution. A person who wishes to present such a notice may, if an objection is made, as the case may be, by the father and mother or the parents as legal tutors, by the tutor, if any, or by the minor 14 years of age or over, submit an application to the court before the notice is presented to the registrar of civil status.
### Chunk 125

2022, c. 22, s. 13. 56. 3. A substitution of the usual given name produces its effects from the 15th day after the publication of the notice of substitution of the usual given name in accordance with the rules determined by government regulation. However, the substitution produces its effects from the day of the alteration of the register of civil status in the following situations where publication is not required: (1) a special exemption from publication has been granted by the Minister of Justice for reasons of general interest; (2) it is clear that the change requested relates to a modification of the person’s gender identity; or (3) the change requested concerns a child under 6 months of age.
### Chunk 126

The registrar of civil status has the authority to authorize a change of name for a serious reason in every case that does not come under the jurisdiction of the court, and in particular where the name generally used does not correspond to that appearing in the act of birth, where the name is of foreign origin or too difficult to pronounce or write in its original form or where the name invites ridicule or has become infamous.
### Chunk 128

The registrar also has such authority where a person applies for the addition to the surname of a part taken from the surname of the father or mother or of one of the parents, as declared in the act of birth. 1991, c. 64, a. 58; I.

Tutorship to an absentee is terminated by his return, by the appointment by him of an administrator to his property, by declaratory judgment of death or by proof of his death. 1991, c. 64, a. 90. 91. In case of superior force, a tutor may also be appointed, as in the case of an absentee, to a person prevented from appearing at his domicile and who is unable to appoint an administrator to his property. 1991, c. 64, a. 91. DIVISION II DECLARATORY JUDGMENT OF DEATH 92.

In the absence of other proof, the place fixed as the place of death is that where the person was last seen.
### Chunk 155

1991, c. 64, a. 94; I. N. 20140501. 95. A declaratory judgment of death produces the same effects as death. 1991, c. 64, a. 95. 96.

1991, c. 64, a. 97; 2002, c. 6, s. 9. 98. A person who has returned shall apply to the court for annulment of the declaratory judgment of death and rectification of the register of civil status. He may also, subject to the rights of third persons, apply to the court for the cancellation or rectification of the particulars or entries made following the declaratory judgment of death and nullified by his return, as if they had been made without right. Any interested person may make the application to the court at the expense of the person who has returned if the latter fails to act.

### Chunk 186

However, in the case of a declaration of filiation, alteration of the act of civil status is conditional upon the consent of the child if he is 14 years of age or over and upon the absence of a bond of filiation established in favour of another person by the acknowledgement of a bond of filiation in the declaration of birth, uninterrupted possession of status or a legal presumption; it is also conditional upon the absence of any objection from a third person within 20 days of the publication of a notice in accordance with the rules determined by government regulation.
### Chunk 187

1991, c. 64, a. 130; 1999, c. 47, s. 8; 2002, c. 6, s. 17; 2023, c. 13, s. 5. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 55 of 556 ### Page 56 131. Where the declaration and the attestation contain particulars that are contradictory yet essential to the establishment of the status of a person, no act of civil status may be drawn up except with the authorization of the court, on the application of the registrar of civil status or of an interested person.
### Chunk 188

1991, c. 64, a. 131. 132. A new act of civil status is drawn up, on the application of an interested person, where a judgment changing an essential particular in an act of civil status, such as the name or filiation of a person, has been notified to the registrar of civil status or where the decision to authorize a change of name or of designation of sex has become final. The same applies where an Aboriginal customary adoption certificate has been notified to the registrar of civil status.
### Chunk 189

To complete the act, the registrar may require the new declaration he draws up to be signed by those who could have signed it if it had been the original declaration. The new act is substituted for the original act; it repeats all the statements and particulars that are not affected by the alterations and, in the case of an adoption with recognition of a preexisting bond of filiation, those relating to that bond, specifying their antecedence. In the case of an Aboriginal customary adoption, the new act in addition makes mention, where applicable, of the rights and obligations that subsist between the adoptee and a parent of origin, with a reference to the altering act.
### Chunk 190

Finally, the substitution is noted in the original act. 1991, c. 64, a. 132; 2016, c. 4, s. 20; 2017, c. 12, s. 2. 132. 0. 1. An Aboriginal customary adoption certificate states the name and sex of the child, the place, date and time of birth, the date of the adoption, the names, dates of birth and places of domicile of the father and mother or of the parents of origin and of the adopters and, where applicable, the new name given to the child. It mentions that the adoption took place in accordance with applicable Aboriginal custom and, where applicable, mentions the recognition of a preexisting bond of filiation, and specifies any rights and obligations that subsist between the adoptee and his parent of origin.
### Chunk 191

The certificate states the date on which it was made and the name, capacity and domicile of its author, and bears the latter’s signature. 2017, c. 12, s. 3; 2022, c. 22, s. 40. 132. 1. Where a child domiciled outside Québec is adopted by a person domiciled in Québec, the registrar of civil status draws up the act of birth on the basis of the judgment rendered in Québec, the decision judicially recognized in Québec or any other act notified to the registrar which, under the law, produces the effects of adoption in Québec.
### Chunk 192

The clerk of the court notifies the judgment to the registrar of civil status as soon as it becomes final and, where applicable, attaches the decision or the act thereto. The Minister of Health and Social Services notifies to the registrar of civil status the certificate issued by the foreign competent authority and the declaration containing the name chosen for the child transmitted to the Minister under the Act to implement the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (chapter M35.
### Chunk 193

1. 3), unless the Minister has applied to the court for a ruling under the second paragraph of section 9 of that Act. Where applicable, the Minister also notifies the certificate drawn up by the Minister under the same section to attest to the conversion of the adoption. The authority that issues an act recognizing an Aboriginal customary adoption notifies it to the registrar of civil status within 30 days after it was issued and attaches the act recognized. 2004, c. 3, s. 13; 2006, c.
### Chunk 194

34, s. 76; 2016, c. 4, s. 21; 2017, c. 12, s. 4. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 56 of 556 ### Page 57 132. 2. The clerk of the court that has rendered a judgment recognizing an act of birth drawn up by a foreign competent authority or recognizing a foreign decision regarding the filiation of a child born of a parental project involving surrogacy in which the woman or the person who gave birth to the child is domiciled outside Québec notifies the judgment to the registrar of civil status as soon as the judgment becomes final.
### Chunk 195

On receipt of the judgment, the registrar of civil status, as the case may be, (1) inserts the act of birth that has been the object of a judicial recognition in the register of civil status; or (2) draws up the act of birth from the foreign decision that has been the object of a judicial recognition, indicating the particulars consistent with the foreign decision and, where that decision has established the child’s filiation with regard to only one of the spouses who formed the parental project, the particulars consistent with the judgment rendered following an application made under the second paragraph of article 541.
### Chunk 196

34. 2023, c. 13, s. 6. 133. Where a declaratory judgment of death is notified to him, the registrar of civil status draws up the act of death, indicating the particulars in accordance with the judgment. 1991, c. 64, a. 133. 133. 1. Where a court has found a person guilty of acts having caused the death of a missing person or the disappearance of a deceased person’s body, any interested person may declare the death of the absentee to the registrar of civil status. A copy of the judgment of guilty, having become final, must be attached to the declaration of death.
### Chunk 197

The registrar draws up the act of death of the absentee. Where the date, time and place of death are unknown, the registrar fixes them on the basis of the particulars of the judgment and the presumptions that may be drawn from the circumstances. The act drawn up by the registrar produces the same effects as a declaratory judgment of death. 2013, c. 27, s. 17. 134. The registrar of civil status makes a notation of the act of marriage or civil union in the act of birth, and makes a notation of the act of death in the act of birth and the act of marriage or civil union.
### Chunk 198

1991, c. 64, a. 134; 1999, c. 47, s. 9; 2002, c. 6, s. 18; 2013, c. 27, s. 18. 135. The registrar of civil status, upon notification of a judgment granting a divorce, shall make a notation of the judgment in the acts of birth and marriage of each of the parties. Upon notification of a joint notarial declaration or a judgment dissolving a civil union, the registrar shall make a notation of the declaration or judgment in the acts of birth and civil union of each of the persons concerned.
### Chunk 199

Upon receiving a declaration of marriage indicating that the spouses were already in a civil union, the registrar shall make a notation of the declaration in the act of civil union. Upon notification of a judgment declaring a marriage or civil union null or annulling a declaratory judgment of death, the registrar shall cancel the act of marriage or civil union or of death, as the case may be, and make the required entries in the register to ensure the coherence of the register. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 200

135; 1999, c. 47, s. 10; 2002, c. 6, s. 19; 2004, c. 23, s. 4; 2013, c. 27, s. 19; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 57 of 556 ### Page 58 136. Where the registrar of civil status makes a notation in an act as a result of a judgment, he enters, in the act, the subject matter and date of the judgment, the court that rendered it and the number of the court record. In any other case, he makes the necessary notations in the act to allow retrieval of the altering act.
### Chunk 201

1991, c. 64, a. 136; I. N. 20151101. 137. The registrar of civil status, upon receiving an act of civil status drawn up outside Québec but relating to a person domiciled in Québec, inserts the act in the register as though it were an act drawn up in Québec. He also inserts the juridical acts drawn up outside Québec which alter or replace acts of civil status in his possession; he then makes the entries in the register. Notwithstanding their insertion in the register, juridical acts, including acts of civil status, drawn up outside Québec retain their status as semiauthentic acts until their validity is recognized by a court in Québec.
### Chunk 202

The registrar shall mention this fact when issuing copies, certificates or attestations as to those acts. 1991, c. 64, a. 137; 1999, c. 47, s. 11; 2013, c. 27, s. 21; I. N. 20140501. 138. Where there is any doubt as to the validity of an act of civil status or a juridical act drawn up outside Québec, the registrar of civil status may refuse to act until the validity of the document is recognized by a court in Québec. 1991, c. 64, a. 138; I. N. 20140501. 139. If an act of civil status drawn up outside Québec has been lost or destroyed or if no copy of it can be obtained, the registrar of civil status shall not draw up an act of civil status or make a notation in an act already in his possession except with the authorization of the court.
### Chunk 203

1991, c. 64, a. 139. 140. Every act of civil status or juridical act made outside Québec and drawn up in a language other than French shall be accompanied by a translation authenticated in Québec. The same applies to Aboriginal customary adoption certificates and to acts recognizing such adoptions drawn up in a language other than French or English. 1991, c. 64, a. 140; 2017, c. 12, s. 5; 2022, c. 14, s. 126. § 3. — Rectification and reconstitution of an act and of the register 141.
### Chunk 204

Except in the cases provided for in this chapter, only the court may order the rectification of an act of civil status or its insertion in the register. The court may also, on the application of an interested person, review any decision of the registrar of civil status relating to an act of civil status. 1991, c. 64, a. 141. 142. The registrar of civil status corrects the clerical errors in all acts. 1991, c. 64, a. 142; 1999, c. 47, s. 12; 2013, c. 27, s. 22. 143. On the basis of the information he obtains, the registrar of civil status reconstitutes, in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 205

01), any act which has been lost or destroyed. 1991, c. 64, a. 143; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP).

The register of civil status is published by the issuing of copies of acts, certificates or attestations bearing the vidimus of the registrar of civil status and the date of issue. Subject to article 137, copies of acts of civil status, certificates and attestations so issued are authentic.
### Chunk 206

1991, c. 64, a. 144; I. N. 20140501. 145. Any document which reproduces in their entirety the statements of an act of civil status, including the notations thereon, as altered, but excluding notations required by regulation which are not essential to the establishment of the status of a person, is a copy of that act. 1991, c. 64, a. 145; 1999, c. 47, s. 13. 146. A certificate of civil status states the person’s name and designation of sex, the place and date of birth as well as the name of the father and mother or of the parents and, if the person is deceased, the place and date of death.
### Chunk 207

It also states, if applicable, the place and date of the person’s marriage or civil union and the name of the spouse. The registrar of civil status may also issue certificates of birth, marriage, civil union or death bearing only the particulars determined by government regulation. 1991, c. 64, a. 146; 2002, c. 6, s. 20; 2022, c. 22, s. 41. 147. An attestation deals with the presence or absence in the register of an act or of a notation required by law to be made in the act.
### Chunk 208

A detailed attestation deals with the information contained in the copy of the attestation of birth transmitted by the accoucheur to the registrar of civil status and with the nature of the changes made to an act of birth, if any. 1991, c. 64, a. 147; 2022, c. 22, s. 42. 148. The registrar of civil status issues a copy of an act or a certificate only to the persons mentioned in the act or to persons who establish their interest. The registrar may require any person applying for a copy of an act or a certificate to produce such documents and information as are necessary to verify the person’s identity or interest.
### Chunk 209

The registrar issues an attestation to all persons who apply therefor if the particular or fact he attests to is of the kind which appears on certificates; otherwise, he issues it only to persons who establish their interest. He issues detailed attestations only to the person whose birth is attested in the act of birth. 1991, c. 64, a. 148; 2001, c. 41, s. 1; 2001, c. 70, s. 1; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 43. 149. Where a new act has been drawn up, only the persons mentioned in the new act may obtain a copy of the original act.
### Chunk 210

In cases of adoption, the adoptee may, in accordance with article 583, obtain a copy of the original act. The same applies for the descendants in the first degree of a deceased adoptee. The other persons mentioned in the new act may obtain a copy of it if the court, having ascertained that the other conditions of law have been met, so authorizes. The authorities responsible under the law for disclosing information about the identity of the parent of origin and information making contact with that parent possible may, pursuant to an application by the adoptee or the adoptee’s descendants in the first degree, if applicable, to obtain that information, obtain a copy of the original act.

### Chunk 212

2017, c. 12, s. 6. 150. The register of civil status may be consulted only with the authorization of the registrar of civil status. Where the registrar allows the register to be consulted, he determines the conditions required for the safeguard of the information it contains. 1991, c. 64, a. 150. DIVISION VI REGULATORY POWERS RELATING TO THE KEEPING AND PUBLICATION OF THE REGISTER OF CIVIL STATUS 151. The registrar of civil status may designate one or more members of his personnel to replace him temporarily if he is absent or unable to act.
### Chunk 213

He may also delegate certain of his functions to his personnel. Designations and delegations under the first paragraph are made in writing. They take effect upon their signature by the registrar of civil status. Acts of designation and delegation must be published in the Gazette officielle du Québec. The additional particulars that may appear on attestations and declarations, the duties payable for the issuing of copies of acts, certificates or attestations and the charge for preparing or altering an act or for consulting the register, as well as the persons or categories of persons who may be exempt from paying the duties, are determined by regulation of the Government.
### Chunk 214

1991, c. 64, a. 151; 1996, c. 21, s. 27; 1999, c. 47, s. 14; 2022, c. 22, s. 45. 152.

The authority that is competent to issue an Aboriginal customary adoption certificate is a person or body domiciled in Québec and designated by the Aboriginal community or nation. The competent authority may not, when called on to act, be a party to the adoption.
### Chunk 216

The act designating such an authority must be notified to the registrar of civil status within 30 days after the designation and, where applicable, the latter must be notified within that same time of the date on which the authority ceases to be competent. 2017, c. 12, s. 7. TITLE FOUR CAPACITY OF PERSONS CHAPTER I MAJORITY AND MINORITY DIVISION I MAJORITY 153. Full age or the age of majority is 18 years. On attaining full age, a person ceases to be a minor and has the full exercise of all his civil rights.
### Chunk 217

1991, c. 64, a. 153. 154. In no case may the capacity of a person of full age be limited except by express provision of law or by a judgment ordering the institution of tutorship to a person of full age, homologating a protection mandate or authorizing temporary representation of an incapable person of full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 154; 2020, c. 11, s. 5. DIVISION II MINORITY 155. A minor exercises his civil rights only to the extent provided by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 155.
### Chunk 218

156. A minor 14 years of age or over is deemed to be of full age for all acts pertaining to his employment or to the practice of his craft or profession. 1991, c. 64, a. 156. 157. A minor may, within the limits imposed by his age and power of discernment, enter into contracts alone to meet his ordinary and usual needs. 1991, c. 64, a. 157. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 61 of 556 ### Page 62 158. Except where he may act alone, a minor is represented by his tutor for the exercise of his civil rights.
### Chunk 219

Unless the law or the nature of the act does not allow it, an act that may be performed by a minor alone may also be validly performed by his representative. 1991, c. 64, a. 158. 159. In judicial matters, a minor shall be represented by his tutor; his actions are brought in the name of his tutor. A minor may, however, with the authorization of the court, institute alone an action relating to his status, to the exercise of parental authority or to an act that he may perform alone; he may in such cases act alone as defendant.
### Chunk 220

1991, c. 64, a. 159. 160. A minor may invoke alone, in his defence, any irregularity arising from lack of representation or incapacity resulting from his minority. 1991, c. 64, a. 160; I. N. 20140501. 161. An act performed alone by a minor where the law does not allow him to act alone or through a representative is absolutely null. 1991, c. 64, a. 161. 162. An act performed by the tutor without the authorization of the court although the nature of the act requires it may be annulled on the application of the minor, without any requirement to prove that he has suffered injury.
### Chunk 221

1991, c. 64, a. 162; I. N. 20140501. 163. An act performed alone by a minor or performed by his tutor without the authorization of the tutorship council although the nature of the act requires it may not be annulled nor the obligations arising from it reduced, on the application of the minor, unless he suffers injury therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 163; I. N. 20140501. 164. A minor may not bring an action in nullity or reduction of his obligations if the injury he suffers is caused by a fortuitous and unforeseen event.
### Chunk 222

A minor may not avoid an extracontractual obligation to redress injury caused to another by his fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 164; I. N. 20140501. 165. The mere declaration by a minor that he is of full age does not deprive him of his action in nullity or in reduction of his obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 165; I. N. 20140501. 166. On attaining full age, a person may confirm an act he performed alone during minority for which he was required to be represented. After the accounts of the tutorship are rendered, he may also confirm an act which his tutor performed without observance of all the formalities.

The tutor may, after obtaining the agreement of the tutorship council, emancipate a minor if he is 16 years of age or over and requests it, by filing a declaration to that effect with the Public Curator. Emancipation is effective from the filing of the declaration. 1991, c.
### Chunk 224

64, a. 167. 168. The court may likewise, after obtaining the advice of the tutor and, where applicable, of the tutorship council, emancipate a minor. A minor may apply alone for his emancipation. 1991, c. 64, a. 168. 169. The tutor shall render an account of his administration to the emancipated minor; he continues, however, to assist him gratuitously. 1991, c. 64, a. 169; 2016, c. 4, s. 22. 170. Emancipation does not put an end to minority nor does it confer all the rights resulting from majority, but it releases the minor from the obligation to be represented for the exercise of his civil rights.
### Chunk 225

1991, c. 64, a. 170. 171. An emancipated minor may establish his own domicile, and he ceases to be under the authority of his father and mother or of his parents. 1991, c. 64, a. 171; 2022, c. 22, s. 46. 172. In addition to the acts that a minor may perform alone, an emancipated minor may perform all acts of simple administration; thus, he may, as a lessee, enter into leases for terms not exceeding three years and make gifts of his property according to his means, provided he does not appreciably reduce his capital.
### Chunk 226

1991, c. 64, a. 172; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 23. 173. An emancipated minor shall be assisted by his tutor for every act beyond simple administration, and in particular in accepting a gift encumbered with a charge or in renouncing a succession. An act performed without assistance may not be annulled nor the obligations arising from it reduced unless the minor suffers injury therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 173; I. N. 20140501. 174. Large loans or borrowings, considering the patrimony of an emancipated minor, and acts of alienation of an immovable or enterprise require the authorization of the court, on the advice of the tutor.
### Chunk 227

In the absence of such authorization, the act may not be annulled or the obligations arising from the act reduced on the application of the minor, unless he suffers injury therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 174; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 24. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 63 of 556 ### Page 64 § 2. — Full emancipation 175. Full emancipation is obtained by marriage. It may also, on the application of the minor, be granted by the court for a serious reason; in that case, the person having parental authority, the tutor and any person having custody of the minor and, where applicable, the tutorship council shall be summoned to give their advice.
### Chunk 228

1991, c. 64, a. 175; I. N. 20140501. 176. Full emancipation enables a minor to exercise his civil rights as if he were of full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 176. § 3. — Certificate of emancipation 2017, c. 18, s. 91. 176. 1. The clerk may issue, to an emancipated minor who so requests, a certificate attesting to his emancipation by the court. The certificate states whether the emancipation is simple or full. 2017, c. 18, s. 91. CHAPTER II TUTORSHIP TO MINORS DIVISION I TUTORSHIP 177.
### Chunk 229

Tutorship is established in the interest of the minor; it is intended to ensure the protection of his person, the administration of his patrimony and, generally, to secure the exercise of his civil rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 177. 178. Tutorship to minors is legal, suppletive or dative. Tutorship resulting from the law is legal. Tutorship for which a tutor is designated by the father or mother or by the parents or one of them, as the case may be, is suppletive or dative; in the case of dative tutorship, the tutor may also be designated by the court.
### Chunk 230

1991, c. 64, a. 178; 2017, c. 12, s. 8; 2022, c. 22, s. 47. 179. Tutorship is a personal office open to every natural person capable of fully exercising his civil rights who is able to assume the office. 1991, c. 64, a. 179. 180. No one may be compelled to accept a dative tutorship except, failing any other person, the director of youth protection or, for tutorship to property, the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 180; I. N. 20151101. 181. Tutorship does not pass to the heirs of the tutor; they are simply accountable for his administration.
### Chunk 231

If they are of full age, they are bound to continue his administration until a new tutor is appointed. 1991, c. 64, a. 181; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 64 of 556 ### Page 65 182. Tutorship exercised by the director of youth protection or the Public Curator is attached to the office. 1991, c. 64, a. 182. 183. The father and mother or the parents, the director of youth protection or the person recommended by him as tutor exercise tutorship gratuitously.
### Chunk 232

However, the father and mother or the parents may receive such remuneration as may be fixed by the court, on the advice of the tutorship council, for the administration of the property of their child where that is one of their principal occupations. 1991, c. 64, a. 183; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 48. 184. A dative tutor may receive such remuneration as is fixed by the court on the advice of the tutorship council or by the father or mother or the parent by whom he is appointed, or by the liquidator of their succession if so authorized.
### Chunk 233

The expenses of the tutorship and the revenue from the property to be administered are taken into account. Such remuneration and, where applicable, the terms and conditions for its renewal by the tutorship council may be fixed by the court when instituting the tutorship or subsequently. 1991, c. 64, a. 184; 2022, c. 22, s. 49; 2020, c. 11, s. 6. 185. Except where divided, tutorship extends to the person and property of the minor. 1991, c. 64, a. 185. 186. Where tutorship extends to the person of the minor and is exercised by a person other than the father or mother or the parents, the tutor acts as the person having parental authority, unless the court decides otherwise.
### Chunk 234

1991, c. 64, a. 186; 2022, c. 22, s. 50. 187. In no case may more than one tutor to the person be appointed, but several tutors to property may be appointed. However, in the case of a suppletive tutorship, two tutors to the person may be appointed. 1991, c. 64, a. 187; 2017, c. 12, s. 9. 188. The tutor to property is responsible for the administration of the property of the minor. Where several tutors to property are appointed, each of them is accountable for the management of the property entrusted to him.
### Chunk 235

1991, c. 64, a. 188; 2020, c. 11, s. 7. 189. A legal person may act as tutor to property, if so authorized by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 189. 190. Whenever a minor has any interest to discuss judicially with his tutor, a tutor ad hoc is appointed to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 190. 191. The tutorship is based at the domicile of the minor. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 65 of 556 ### Page 66 If a tutorship is exercised by the director of youth protection or by the Public Curator, the tutorship is based at the place where that person holds office.
### Chunk 236

1991, c. 64, a. 191; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II LEGAL TUTORSHIP 192. In addition to having the rights and duties connected with parental authority, the father and mother or the parents, if of full age or emancipated, are, by operation of law, tutors to their minor child for the purposes of representing him in the exercise of his civil rights and administering his patrimony. They are also tutors to their child conceived but yet unborn and are responsible for acting on his behalf in all cases where his patrimonial interests require it.
### Chunk 237

1991, c. 64, a. 192; I. N. 20151101; 2022, c. 22, s. 51. 193. The father and mother or the parents exercise tutorship together unless one of them is deceased or prevented from expressing their wishes or from doing so in due time. 1991, c. 64, a. 193; 2022, c. 22, s. 52. 194. Either parent may give the other the mandate to represent him in the performance of acts pertaining to the exercise of tutorship. The mandate is presumed with regard to third persons in good faith.
### Chunk 238

1991, c. 64, a. 194. 195. Where the custody of a child is decided by judgment, the tutorship continues to be exercised by the father and mother or the parents, unless the court, for grave reasons, decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 195; 2022, c. 22, s. 53. 196. In case of disagreement relating to the exercise of the tutorship between the father and mother or the parents, either of them may refer the dispute to the court. The court decides in the interest of the minor after fostering the conciliation of the parties and, if need be, obtaining the advice of the tutorship council.
### Chunk 239

1991, c. 64, a. 196; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 54. 197. Deprivation of parental authority entails loss of tutorship; withdrawal of certain attributes of parental authority or of the exercise of such attributes entails loss of tutorship only if so decided by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 197. 198. A father or mother or a parent deprived of tutorship as a result of having been deprived of parental authority or having had the exercise of certain attributes of parental authority withdrawn may, even after dative tutorship is instituted, be reinstated as tutor once he or she again has full exercise of parental authority.
### Chunk 240

1991, c. 64, a. 198; 2022, c. 22, s. 55. 199. Where the court declares the father and mother or the parents of a minor deprived of parental authority without appointing another tutor, the director of youth protection having jurisdiction in the child’s place of residence becomes by virtue of his office legal tutor to the child unless the child is already provided with a tutor other than his father and mother or his parents. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 66 of 556 ### Page 67 The director of youth protection is also, until the order of placement, legal tutor to a child he has caused to be declared eligible for adoption or in whose respect he has received a general consent to adoption, except where the court has appointed another tutor.
### Chunk 241

1991, c. 64, a. 199; 2022, c. 22, s. 56. DIVISION II. 1 SUPPLETIVE TUTORSHIP 2017, c. 12, s. 10. 199. 1. The father or mother of a minor child or the child’s parents or one of them may designate a person to whom may be delegated or with whom may be shared the offices of legal tutor and of person having parental authority where it is impossible for them or for one of them to fully assume those offices or where there is disengagement toward the child. Only the spouse of one of them, an ascendant of the child, a relative in the collateral line to the third degree, a spouse of that ascendant or relative or a member of the child’s foster family may be so designated as tutor.
### Chunk 242

2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 57. 199. 2. Such a designation must be authorized by the court on the application of the father or mother or of the parents or one of them. If the father and mother or the parents are prevented from expressing their wishes, any person who may be designated as tutor and who, in fact or by law, has custody of the child may apply to the court to be entrusted with the offices of legal tutor and of person having parental authority. 2017, c. 12, s.
### Chunk 243

10; 2022, c. 22, s. 58. 199. 3. The court authorizes the designation with the consent of the father or mother or of the parents or one of them. If the court fails to obtain such consent for any reason or if the refusal expressed by one of them is not justified by the interest of the child, the court may authorize the designation. 2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 59. 199. 4. If the child is 10 years of age or over, the designation may not take place without the child’s consent, unless he is unable to express his will.
### Chunk 244

However, the court may authorize the designation despite the child’s refusal, unless the child is 14 years of age or over. 2017, c. 12, s. 10. 199. 5. Any interested person may contest the delegation or sharing of the offices of legal tutor and of person having parental authority as well as the designation of the tutor. However, another person may not be substituted for the tutor designated by the father or the mother or by the parents or one of them without their consent, unless they are prevented from expressing their will.
### Chunk 245

2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 60. 199. 6. The designation of a suppletive tutor entails, for the father or mother or parent who is unable to fully assume the offices of legal tutor and of person having parental authority, the suspension of those offices. 2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 61. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 67 of 556 ### Page 68 199. 7. Any provision relating to tutorship and parental authority that applies to the father or mother or one of the parents also applies, with the necessary modifications, to the suppletive tutor, except provisions relating to the appointment of a dative tutor and to deprivation of parental authority.
### Chunk 246

2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 62. 199. 8. The father or mother or one of the parents may, if new facts arise, be reinstated by the court as legal tutor and as person having parental authority on the application of either of them, the tutor, or the child if he is 10 years of age or over. 2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 63. 199. 9. Except in the cases provided for in this chapter, the office of tutor ceases when the rules for the institution of a dative tutorship begin to apply.
### Chunk 247

In addition, the tutor may apply to the court to be relieved of his duties provided notice of the application has been given to the father or mother or to the parents or one of them, and to the child if he is 10 years of age or over. 2017, c. 12, s. 10; 2022, c. 22, s. 64. 199. 10. Conditions under any Québec Aboriginal custom that is in harmony with the principles of the interest of the child, respect for the child’s rights and the consent of the persons concerned may be substituted for conditions of suppletive tutorship.
### Chunk 248

In such cases, the provisions of this division, except articles 199. 6 and 199. 7, do not apply. Such a tutorship is, on the application of the child or the tutor, attested by the authority that is competent for the Aboriginal community or nation of either the child or the tutor. However, if the child and the tutor are members of different nations, the tutorship is attested by the authority that is competent for the child’s nation or community. The competent authority issues a certificate attesting the tutorship after making sure that it was carried out according to custom, in particular that the required consents were validly given and that the child is in the care of the tutor; the authority also makes sure that the tutorship is in the interest of the child.
### Chunk 249

The authority is a person or body domiciled in Québec and designated by the Aboriginal community or nation. The competent authority may not, when called on to act, be a party to the tutorship. 2017, c. 12, s. 10. DIVISION III DATIVE TUTORSHIP 200. The father or mother or one of the parents may appoint a tutor to their minor child by will, by a protection mandate or by filing a declaration to that effect with the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 200; 1998, c. 51, s. 22; I. N.
### Chunk 250

20160101 (NCCP); 2022, c. 22, s. 65. 201. The right to appoint a tutor belongs exclusively to the last surviving person among the father and mother or among the parents or to the last person among them who is able to exercise tutorship, as the case may be, if that person has retained legal tutorship to the day of their death. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 68 of 556 ### Page 69 Where the father and mother or the parents die simultaneously or lose the ability to exercise tutorship during the same event, each having designated a different person as tutor, and both persons accept the office, the court decides which person will exercise it.
### Chunk 251

1991, c. 64, a. 201; 1998, c. 51, s. 23; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 66. 202. Unless the designation is contested, the tutor appointed by the father or mother or one of the parents assumes office upon accepting it. If the person does not refuse the office within 30 days after learning of his appointment, he is presumed to have accepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 202; 1998, c. 51, s. 24; 2016, c. 4, s. 25; 2022, c. 22, s. 67. 203. Whether the tutor appointed by the father or mother or one of the parents accepts or refuses the office, he shall notify the liquidator of the succession and the Public Curator.
### Chunk 252

1991, c. 64, a. 203; 2022, c. 22, s. 68. 204. Where the person appointed by either parent refuses the tutorship, he shall without delay give notice of his refusal to the replacement, if any, designated by the parent. The person may, however, retract his refusal before the replacement accepts the office or an application to institute tutorship is made to the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 204; I. N. 20140501. 205. Tutorship is conferred by the court where it is expedient to appoint a tutor or a replacement, to appoint a tutor ad hoc or a tutor to property or where the designation of a tutor appointed by the father and mother or by the parents is contested.
### Chunk 253

Tutorship is conferred on the advice of the tutorship council, unless it is applied for by the director of youth protection. 1991, c. 64, a. 205; 2022, c. 22, s. 69. 206. The minor, the father or mother or one of the parents, close relatives and persons closely connected to the minor by marriage or a civil union, or any other interested person, including the Public Curator, may apply to the court and, if necessary, propose a suitable person who is willing to accept the tutorship.
### Chunk 254

1991, c. 64, a. 206; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; 2016, c. 4, s. 26; 2022, c. 22, s. 70. 207. The director of youth protection or the person recommended as tutor by him may also apply for the institution of tutorship to an orphan who is a minor and who has no tutor, or to a child whose father and mother or whose parents both fail, in fact, to assume his care, maintenance or education, or to a child who in all likelihood would be in danger if he returned to his father and mother or to his parents.
### Chunk 255

1991, c. 64, a. 207; 2022, c. 22, s. 71. DIVISION IV ADMINISTRATION OF TUTORS 208. With respect to the property of the minor, the tutor acts as an administrator charged with simple administration. 1991, c. 64, a. 208; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 69 of 556 ### Page 70 209. In administering the property of their minor child, fathers and mothers or parents are not bound to make an inventory of the property, furnish security for their administration, render an annual account of their management, or obtain any advice or authorization from the tutorship council or the court unless the property is worth more than $40,000 or the court so orders upon the application of an interested person.
### Chunk 256

1991, c. 64, a. 209; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 72; 2020, c. 11, s. 8. 210. All property given or bequeathed to a minor on condition that it be administered by a third person is withdrawn from the administration of the tutor. If the act does not indicate the particular mode of administration of the property, the person administering it has the rights and obligations of a tutor to property. 1991, c. 64, a. 210. 211. A tutor may accept alone any gift in favour of his pupil.
### Chunk 257

He may not accept any gift with a charge, however, without obtaining the authorization of the tutorship council. 1991, c. 64, a. 211. 212. A tutor may not transact or bring an appeal without the authorization of the tutorship council. 1991, c. 64, a. 212; I. N. 20140501. 213. The tutor, before contracting a significant loan in relation to the patrimony of the minor, offering property as security, alienating important family property, an immovable or an enterprise, or demanding the definitive partition of immovables held by the minor in undivided coownership, shall obtain the authorization of the tutorship council or, if the property or security is worth more than $40,000, of the court, which seeks the advice of the tutorship council.
### Chunk 258

The tutorship council or the court does not allow the loan to be contracted, or property to be alienated by onerous title or offered as security, except where that is necessary to ensure the education and maintenance of the minor, to pay his debts, to maintain the property in good order or to safeguard the value of his patrimony. The authorization then indicates the amount and conditions of the loan, the property that may be alienated or offered as security, and sets forth the conditions under which it may be done.
### Chunk 259

1991, c. 64, a. 213; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 9. 214. No tutor may, without first obtaining an expert’s appraisal, alienate property worth more than $40,000, except in the case of securities listed and traded on a recognized stock exchange in accordance with the provisions relating to investments presumed sound. A copy of the appraisal is attached to the annual management account. Juridical acts which are related according to their nature, their object or the time they are performed constitute one and the same act.
### Chunk 260

1991, c. 64, a. 214; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 10. 215. A tutor acting alone may enter into an agreement to continue in indivision, but in that case the minor may terminate the agreement within one year after reaching the age of majority, regardless of its term. An agreement authorized by the tutorship council and by the court is binding on the minor once he attains full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 215; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 70 of 556 ### Page 71 216.
### Chunk 261

The clerk of the court gives notice without delay to the tutorship council and to the Public Curator of any judgment relating to the patrimonial interests of a minor and of any transaction effected pursuant to an action to which the tutor is a party in that quality. 1991, c. 64, a. 216; I. N. 20140501. 217. Where the property is worth more than $40,000, the liquidator of a succession which devolves or is bequeathed to a minor and the donor of property if the donee is a minor and, in any case, any person who pays an indemnity for the benefit of a minor, shall notify the Public Curator and state the value of the property or the amount of the indemnity, as the case may be, at least 15 days before its transmission or payment.
### Chunk 262

The 15day notice period prescribed in the first paragraph does not apply to the payment of an indemnity the object of which is to make good on the obligation of support that lies on parents with respect to their child. 1991, c. 64, a. 217; 2020, c. 11, s. 11. 218. A tutor takes out of the property under his administration all sums necessary to pay the expenses of the tutorship, in particular, to provide for the exercise of the civil rights of the minor and the administration of his patrimony.
### Chunk 263

He also does so where, to ensure the minor’s maintenance and education, it is necessary to make good on the obligation of support that lies on the father and mother or the parents. 1991, c. 64, a. 218; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 27; 2022, c. 22, s. 73. 219. The tutor to the person agrees with the tutor to property as to the amounts he requires each year to pay the expenses of the tutorship. If the tutors do not agree on the amounts or their payment, the tutorship council or, failing that, the court decides.
### Chunk 264

1991, c. 64, a. 219. 220. The minor manages the proceeds of his work and any allowances paid to him to meet his ordinary and usual needs. Where the revenues of the minor are considerable or where justified by the circumstances, the court, after obtaining the advice of the tutor and, where applicable, the tutorship council, may fix the amounts that remain under the management of the minor. It takes into account the age and power of discernment of the minor, the general conditions of his maintenance and education and his obligations of support and those of his parents.
### Chunk 265

1991, c. 64, a. 220. 221. A director of youth protection exercising a tutorship or the person he recommends to exercise it shall obtain the authorization of the court where the law requires the tutor to obtain the advice or authorization of the tutorship council before acting. Where the property is worth more than $40,000, however, or, in all cases where the court so orders, tutorship to property is conferred on the Public Curator, who has from that time the rights and obligations of a dative tutor, subject to the provisions of law.

The role of the tutorship council is to supervise the tutorship. The tutorship council is composed of three persons designated by a meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends or, if the court so decides, is composed of only one person.
### Chunk 267

1991, c. 64, a. 222; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 28. 223. A tutorship council is established both in the case of dative tutorship and in that of legal tutorship, although, in the latter case, only where the father and mother or the parents are bound, with respect to the administration of the property of the minor, to make an inventory, to furnish security or to render an annual account of management. No council is established where the tutorship is exercised by the director of youth protection, a person he has recommended as tutor, or the Public Curator.
### Chunk 268

1991, c. 64, a. 223; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 74. 224. Any interested person may initiate the establishment of a tutorship council by applying either to a notary, or to the court of the place where the minor has his domicile or residence, for the calling of a meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends. The court examining an application for the appointment or replacement of a tutor or tutorship council may do likewise, even of its own motion.
### Chunk 269

1991, c. 64, a. 224; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 29. 225. The tutor, appointed by the father or mother or by one of the parents of a minor, or the parents, as the case may be, shall initiate the establishment of the tutorship council. The father and mother or the parents may, at their option, call a meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends or make an application to the court for the establishment of a tutorship council composed of only one person designated by the court.
### Chunk 270

1991, c. 64, a. 225; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 30; 2022, c. 22, s. 75. 226. The father and mother or the parents of the minor and, if they have a known residence in Québec, his other ascendants and his brothers and sisters of full age shall be called to the meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends called to establish a tutorship council. The other relatives of the minor and persons connected to him by marriage or a civil union, and his friends may be called to the meeting provided they are of full age.
### Chunk 271

At least five persons representing, so far as possible, the maternal and paternal lines shall be called to the meeting. The meeting shall be held regardless of the number of persons participating in it. It may be held by a technological means. 1991, c. 64, a. 226; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; 2016, c. 4, s. 31; 2022, c. 22, s. 76; 2020, c. 11, s. 13. 227. Persons who shall be called are always entitled to participate in the meeting which establishes the tutorship council and give their advice even if they were not called.

1991, c. 64, a. 227; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 14. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 72 of 556 ### Page 73 228. The meeting appoints the three members of the council and designates two alternates, giving consideration so far as possible to representation of the maternal and paternal lines or the lines of each of the two parents. It also appoints a secretary, who may or may not be a member of the council, responsible for taking and keeping the minutes of the deliberations; it fixes the remuneration of the secretary, where applicable.
### Chunk 273

The tutor may not be a member of the tutorship council. 1991, c. 64, a. 228; 2022, c. 22, s. 77. 229. Vacancies are filled by the council by selecting a designated alternate in the line where the vacancy occurred. If there is no alternate, the council selects a relative or a person connected by marriage or a civil union in the same line or, if none, a relative or a person connected by marriage or a civil union in the other line or a friend. 1991, c. 64, a. 229; 2002, c. 6, s.
### Chunk 274

235. 230. The tutorship council is bound to invite the tutor to each of its meetings to hear his advice; the minor may be invited. 1991, c. 64, a. 230; I. N. 20140501. 231. The court may, on application or of its own motion, rule that the tutorship council will be composed of only one person designated by it where, owing to the family members being geographically distant, their indifference or a major impediment to them, or owing to the personal or family situation of the minor, it would be inadvisable to establish a council composed of three persons.
### Chunk 275

The court may in such a case designate a person who shows a special interest in the minor or, failing that, the director of youth protection or the Public Curator, if he is not already the tutor. The court may exempt the person making the application from first calling a meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends if it is shown that sufficient effort has been made to call the meeting, but that such effort has been in vain. 1991, c. 64, a. 231; 2002, c.
### Chunk 276

6, s. 235; 2016, c. 4, s. 32. 232. Excepting the director of youth protection and the Public Curator, no one may be compelled to accept membership in the council; a person who has agreed to become a member may be released at any time provided it is not done at an inopportune moment. Membership in a tutorship council is an office that is personal and gratuitous. 1991, c. 64, a. 232; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 2. — Rights and obligations of the council 233. The tutorship council gives advice and makes decisions in every case provided for by law.
### Chunk 277

Moreover, where the rules for administration of the property of others provide that the beneficiary shall or may give his consent to an act, obtain advice or be consulted, the council acts on behalf of the minor who is the beneficiary. 1991, c. 64, a. 233; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 73 of 556 ### Page 74 233. 1. Where two or more tutors are appointed for a minor and a disagreement arises between them, the tutorship council facilitates its settlement.
### Chunk 278

Failing agreement between the tutors, the court decides, on the application of any interested person, including the Public Curator. 2020, c. 11, s. 15. 234. The council, where composed of three persons, meets at least once a year; deliberations are not valid unless a majority of its members attend the meeting or unless all the members can express themselves by a means which allows all of them to communicate directly with each other. The decisions and advice of the council are taken or given by majority vote; each member shall give reasons.
### Chunk 279

As soon as it is established and whenever there is a change in its composition, the council informs the minor, if 14 years of age or older, and the minor’s tutor, providing the names and contact information of its members and its secretary. The council also informs the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 234; 2014, c. 1, s. 784. 235. Whenever a minor has any interest to discuss judicially with his tutor, the council causes a tutor ad hoc to be appointed to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 235.
### Chunk 280

236. The council ascertains that the tutor makes an inventory of the property of the minor and that he furnishes and maintains a security. The council receives the annual management account from the tutor and is entitled to examine all documents and vouchers supporting the account and obtain a copy of them. 1991, c. 64, a. 236; 2016, c. 4, s. 33. 237. Any interested person may, for a grave reason, apply to the court within 10 days to have a decision of the council reviewed or for authorization to initiate the establishment of a new council.
### Chunk 281

When an application for the review of a council decision is notified to the council secretary, the latter sends the minutes and the record relating to the decision to the office of the court without delay. Any document to be notified to the council is notified to the council secretary. 1991, c. 64, a. 237; 2014, c. 1, s. 785. 238. The tutor may demand the convening of the council or, if it cannot be convened, apply to the court for authorization to act alone. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 282

238. 239. The council is responsible for seeing that the records of the tutorship are preserved and for transmitting them to the minor or his heirs at the end of the tutorship. 1991, c. 64, a. 239. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 74 of 556 ### Page 75 DIVISION VI SUPERVISION OF TUTORSHIPS § 1. — Inventory 240. Within 60 days of the institution of the tutorship, the tutor shall make an inventory of the property to be administered. He shall do the same for property devolved to the minor after the tutorship is instituted.
### Chunk 283

A copy of the inventory is transmitted to the Public Curator and to the tutorship council. 1991, c. 64, a. 240; I. N. 20140501. 241. A tutor who continues the administration of another tutor after the rendering of account is exempt from making an inventory. 1991, c. 64, a. 241. § 2. — Security 242. The tutor is bound, if the value of the property to be administered exceeds $40,000, to take out insurance or furnish other security to guarantee the performance of his obligations.
### Chunk 284

The kind and object of the security and the time granted to furnish it are determined by the tutorship council. If they have not been determined within six months after the institution of tutorship, they may be determined by the Public Curator. The tutorship is liable for the costs of the security. 1991, c. 64, a. 242; 2016, c. 4, s. 34; 2020, c. 11, s. 16. 243. The tutor shall without delay furnish proof of the security to the tutorship council and to the Public Curator.
### Chunk 285

The tutor shall maintain the security or another of sufficient value for the duration of his office and furnish proof of it every year. 1991, c. 64, a. 243. 244. A legal person exercising tutorship to property is exempt from furnishing security. 1991, c. 64, a. 244. 245. Where it is advisable to release the security, the tutorship council or the minor, once he attains full age, may do so and, at the cost of the tutorship, apply for cancellation of the registration, if any. Notice of the cancellation is given to the Public Curator.
### Chunk 286

1991, c. 64, a. 245. § 3. — Reports and accounts 246. The tutor sends the annual account of his management to the minor 14 years of age or over, to the tutorship council and to the Public Curator. The tutor to property renders an annual account to the tutor to the person. 1991, c. 64, a. 246. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 75 of 556 ### Page 76 247. At the end of his administration, the tutor shall give a final account to the minor who has come of age; he shall also give an account to the tutor who replaces him and to the minor 14 years of age or over or, where applicable, to the liquidator of the succession of the minor.
### Chunk 287

He shall send a copy of his final account to the tutorship council and to the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 247. 248. Every agreement between the tutor and the minor who has come of age relating to the administration or the account is null unless it is preceded by a detailed rendering of account and the delivery of the related vouchers. 1991, c. 64, a. 248. 249. The Public Curator examines the annual accounts of management and the final account of the tutor. He also ascertains that the security is maintained.
### Chunk 288

He may require any document and any explanation concerning the accounts and, where provided for by law, require that they be audited. 1991, c. 64, a. 249. DIVISION VII REPLACEMENT OF TUTOR AND END OF TUTORSHIP 250. A dative tutor may, for a serious reason, apply to the court to be relieved of his duties, provided his application is not made at an inopportune moment and notice of it has been given to the tutorship council. 1991, c. 64, a. 250. 251. The tutorship council or, in case of emergency, one of its members shall apply for the replacement of a tutor who is unable to perform his duties or neglects his obligations.
### Chunk 289

A tutor to the person shall act in the same manner with regard to a tutor to property. Any interested person, including the Public Curator, may also, for the reasons set forth in the first paragraph, apply for the replacement of the tutor. 1991, c. 64, a. 251. 252. Where tutorship is exercised by the director of youth protection, by a person he recommends as tutor or by the Public Curator, any interested person may apply for his replacement without having to justify it for any reason other than the interest of the minor.
### Chunk 290

1991, c. 64, a. 252. 253. During the proceedings, the tutor continues to exercise his duties unless the court decides otherwise and appoints a provisional administrator charged with simple administration of the property of the minor. 1991, c. 64, a. 253; I. N. 20151101. 254. Every judgment terminating the duties of a tutor contains the reasons for replacing him and designates the new tutor. 1991, c. 64, a. 254. 255. Tutorship ends when the minor attains full age, obtains full emancipation or dies.
### Chunk 291

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 76 of 556 ### Page 77 The office of a tutor ceases at the end of the tutorship, when the tutor is replaced or on his death. 1991, c. 64, a. 255. CHAPTER III TUTORSHIP TO PERSONS OF FULL AGE 1991, c. 64, c. III; 2020, c. 11, s. 17. DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS 256. Tutorship to a person of full age is established in his interest and is intended to ensure the protection of his person, the administration of his patrimony and, generally, the exercise of his civil rights.
### Chunk 292

Any incapacity resulting from the tutorship is established solely in favour of the person under tutorship. 1991, c. 64, a. 256; 2020, c. 11, s. 18. 257. Every decision relating to the institution of tutorship to a person of full age or concerning a person of full age under tutorship shall be in his interest, respect his rights and safeguard his autonomy, taking into account his wishes and preferences. The person of full age shall, so far as possible and without delay, be informed of the decision.
### Chunk 293

1991, c. 64, a. 257; 2020, c. 11, s. 19. 258. A tutor is appointed to represent a person of full age who is incapable of caring for himself or herself or of administering property by reason, in particular, of illness, deficiency or debility due to age which impairs the person’s mental faculties or physical ability to express his or her will. A tutor may also be appointed to a prodigal who endangers the wellbeing of his or her married or civil union spouse or minor children. 1991, c.
### Chunk 294

64, a. 258; 2002, c. 6, s. 21; 2020, c. 11, s. 20. 259. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 259; 2020, c. 11, s. 21. 260. The tutor to a person of full age is responsible for his custody and maintenance, unless the court decides otherwise; he is also responsible for ensuring the moral and material wellbeing of the person of full age, taking into account his condition, needs and faculties and the other aspects of his situation. He may delegate the exercise of the custody and maintenance of the person of full age but, so far as possible, he and the delegated person shall maintain a personal relationship with the person of full age, involve him in the decisions made in his regard and keep him informed of those decisions.
### Chunk 295

1991, c. 64, a. 260; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; 2020, c. 11, s. 22. 261. The Public Curator does not exercise tutorship to a person of full age unless he is appointed by the court to do so; he may also act by virtue of his office if the person of full age is no longer provided with a tutor. 1991, c. 64, a. 261; 2020, c. 11, s. 23. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 77 of 556 ### Page 78 262. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 262; 2020, c.
### Chunk 296

11, s. 24. 263. The Public Curator does not have custody of the person of full age to whom he is appointed tutor unless, where no other person can assume it, the court entrusts it to him. He is nevertheless, in all cases, responsible for ensuring the protection of the person of full age. The person to whom custody is entrusted, however, has the powers of a tutor to give consent to care required by the state of health of the person of full age, except care for which the Public Curator elects to reserve to himself the power to give consent.
### Chunk 297

1991, c. 64, a. 263; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 35; 2020, c. 11, s. 25. 264. The Public Curator acting as tutor to a person of full age may delegate the exercise of certain functions related to tutorship to a person he designates after ascertaining, where the person of full age is being treated in a health or social services establishment, that the designated person is not an employee of the establishment and has no duties therewith. He may, however, where circumstances warrant, disregard this restriction if the employee of the establishment is the spouse or a close relative of the person of full age or if the function delegated is the management, according to the Public Curator’s instructions, of the monthly personal expense allowance granted to the person of full age.
### Chunk 298

The Public Curator may authorize the delegate to give consent to care required by the state of health of the person of full age, except care for which the Public Curator elects to reserve to himself the power to give consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 264; 1999, c. 30, s. 21; 2016, c. 4, s. 36; 2020, c. 11, s. 26. 265. At least once a year, the delegate renders account of the exercise of the custody to the Public Curator. The Public Curator may revoke the delegation if there is a conflict of interest between the delegate and the person of full age or for any other serious reason.
### Chunk 299

1991, c. 64, a. 265; 2020, c. 11, s. 27. 266. The rules pertaining to tutorship to minors, except those set out in article 217, apply, adapted as required, to tutorship to persons of full age. Thus, the spouse and descendants in the first degree of the person of full age shall be called to the meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends, along with the persons to be called to it pursuant to article 226. 1991, c. 64, a. 266; 1998, c. 51, s.
### Chunk 300

25; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; 2016, c. 4, s. 37; 2020, c. 11, s. 28. 267. Where the person who applies for the institution or review of tutorship to a person of full age, including the Public Curator, shows that it is impossible to call five persons to the meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends, the court may reduce the number of persons to be called. The court may also exempt the person from calling a meeting of relatives, persons connected by marriage or a civil union, or friends if it is shown that sufficient effort has been made to call the meeting, but that such effort has been in vain.
### Chunk 301

1991, c. 64, a. 267; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 38; 2020, c. 11, s. 29. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 78 of 556 ### Page 79 DIVISION II INSTITUTION OF TUTORSHIP TO PERSONS OF FULL AGE 1991, c. 64, Div. II; 2020, c. 11, s. 30. 268. The court institutes tutorship if it is established that the person of full age is incapable of caring for himself or of administering his property, and needs to be represented in the exercise of his civil rights.
### Chunk 302

The court then appoints a tutor to the person and to property, or a tutor either to the person or to property. It may also appoint a replacement tutor. The court is not bound by the application. It may establish a tutorship the nature, terms and conditions of which are different from those applied for or authorize temporary representation of the incapable person of full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 268; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 31. 268. 1. The court may appoint two tutors to the person when these are the father and mother of the person of full age.
### Chunk 303

Either parent may give the other the mandate to represent him in the performance of acts pertaining to the exercise of tutorship. Such a mandate is presumed with regard to third persons in good faith. 2020, c. 11, s. 32. 269. The person of full age himself, his spouse, his close relatives, persons closely connected to him by marriage or a civil union, any person showing a special interest in the person or any other interested person, including the mandatary designated by the person of full age or the Public Curator, may apply for the institution of tutorship.
### Chunk 304

1991, c. 64, a. 269; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; 2016, c. 4, s. 39; 2020, c. 11, s. 33. 270. Where a person of full age receiving care or services from a health or social services establishment requires to be represented in the exercise of his civil rights by reason of his isolation, the foreseeable duration of his incapacity, the nature or state of his affairs or because no mandatary already designated by him gives him adequate representation, the executive director of the health or social services institution reports that fact to the Public Curator, transmits a copy of his report to the person of full age and so informs a person close to that person.
### Chunk 305

Such a report includes the medical and psychosocial assessments resulting from an examination of the person of full age; it deals with the nature of his incapacity, his faculties, his environment, the extent of his needs and the other circumstances of his condition, the advisability of instituting tutorship for him as well as the time limits for medical and psychosocial reassessments. It also sets out the names, if known, of the persons qualified to apply for the institution of tutorship. 1991, c.
### Chunk 306

64, a. 270; 2016, c. 4, s. 40; 2020, c. 11, s. 34. 271. The institution of tutorship to a person of full age may be applied for in the year preceding his attaining full age. The judgment takes effect on the day the person attains full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 271; 2020, c. 11, s. 35. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 79 of 556 ### Page 80 272. During proceedings, the court may, even of its own motion, decide on the custody of the person of full age if it is clear that he is unable to care for himself and that custody is required to prevent serious injury for him.
### Chunk 307

Even before the proceedings, the Court may, if an application for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age is about to be made and it is necessary to act to prevent serious injury for the person of full age, provisionally designate the Public Curator or another person to ensure the personal protection of the person of full age or to represent him in the exercise of his civil rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 272; 1999, c. 30, s. 22; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 41; 2020, c.
### Chunk 308

11, s. 36. 273. An act under which the person of full age has already charged another person with the administration of his property continues to produce its effects notwithstanding the proceedings unless it is revoked by the court for a serious reason. If no mandate has been given by the person of full age or by the court under article 444, the rules for the management of the business of another apply and the Public Curator and any other person who is qualified to apply for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age may, in an emergency or even before proceedings if an application for the institution of such tutorship is about to be made, perform the acts required to preserve the patrimony.
### Chunk 309

1991, c. 64, a. 273; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 11, s. 37. 274. In cases where there is no mandate or management of the business of another or even before proceedings if an application for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age is about to be made, the court may, if it is necessary to act in order to prevent serious injury, provisionally designate the Public Curator or another person either to perform a specific act or to administer the property of the person of full age within the limits of simple administration of the property of others.
### Chunk 310

1991, c. 64, a. 274; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 38. 275. During proceedings and thereafter, the dwelling of the person of full age and the movable property with which it is furnished are kept at his disposal. The power to administer that property extends only to agreements granting precarious enjoyment, which cease to have effect by operation of law upon the return of the person of full age. Should it be necessary or in the best interest of the person of full age that the movable property or the rights relating to the dwelling be disposed of, the act may be done only with the authorization of the tutorship council.
### Chunk 311

Even in such a case, except for a compelling reason, souvenirs and other personal effects may not be disposed of and shall, so far as possible, be kept at the disposal of the person of full age by the health or social services establishment. 1991, c. 64, a. 275; 2016, c. 4, s. 42; 2020, c. 11, s. 39. 276. Where the court examines an application for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age, it takes into consideration, in addition to the advice of the persons who may be called to form the tutorship council, the medical and psychosocial evidence, the wishes and preferences expressed by the person of full age, including those expressed in a protection mandate which has not been homologated, and the degree of autonomy of the person in whose respect the institution of tutorship is applied for.
### Chunk 312

The court shall give to the person of full age an opportunity to be heard, personally or through a representative where required by his state of health, on the merits of the application and, where applicable, on the nature, terms and conditions of the tutorship as well as on the person who will represent him. 1991, c. 64, a. 276; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2020, c. 11, s. 40. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 80 of 556 ### Page 81 277. A judgment concerning tutorship to a person of full age may be reviewed at any time.
### Chunk 313

1991, c. 64, a. 277; 2020, c. 11, s. 41. 278. When instituting the tutorship, the court determines the time limits for periodic reassessment of the person of full age. The time limits for reassessment may not exceed five years. A longer time limit may however be set for the medical reassessment, without exceeding 10 years, when it is clear that the situation of the person of full age will remain unchanged. Those time limits are determined taking into account the recommendations made in the medical and psychosocial assessment reports concerning the person of full age, the nature of his incapacity, the extent of his needs and the other circumstances of his condition.
### Chunk 314

The tutor is bound to see to it that the person of full age undergoes the assessments within the fixed time limits. The person of full age may, at any time, apply to be reassessed. 1991, c. 64, a. 278; 2020, c. 11, s. 42. 278. 1. Where the medical or psychosocial assessor becomes aware that the situation of the person of full age has changed sufficiently to justify modifying or terminating the tutorship, the assessor attests to that fact in a report, indicating any modifications he considers appropriate.
### Chunk 315

The assessor transmits the report to the person of full age, to the tutor and to the executive director of a health or social services institution providing care or services to the person of full age or, failing that, the executive director of a health or social services institution that has jurisdiction in the territory in which the person of full age resides. The director then obtains the report of the other assessor, transmits a copy of it to the person of full age and to the tutor, and files a copy of both reports in the office of the court.
### Chunk 316

Where the medical or psychosocial assessor considers that the time limit for the reassessment of the person of full age should be modified, the assessor attests to that fact in a report, indicating the time limit he considers appropriate. He transmits the report to the person of full age and the tutor. The tutor shall then file a copy of the report concerned in the office of the court. 2020, c. 11, s. 43. 279. The executive director of the health or social services institution providing care or services to the person of full age shall, if the incapacity or need for representation that justified tutorship to a person of full age ceases, attest to that fact in a report which he files in the office of the court.
### Chunk 317

Such a report includes the medical and psychosocial assessments. 1991, c. 64, a. 279; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 44. 280. On the filing of the report or reports on the review of a tutorship to a person of full age, the clerk notifies the person of full age, the tutor and the persons qualified to intervene in the application for the institution of tutorship. If no objection is made within 30 days after the date of the notice, release from or the modification of the tutorship takes effect by operation of law.
### Chunk 318

An attestation is drawn up by the clerk and transmitted without delay to the person of full age, to his tutor, to the tutorship council and to the Public Curator. Those rules also apply to the review of a time limit for the medical or psychosocial reassessment of a person of full age, on the filing of the relevant report. 1991, c. 64, a. 280; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I.

The tutor has the simple administration of the property of the person of full age incapable of administering his property. He exercises his administration in the same manner as the tutor to a minor, unless the court decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 286. 287. The rules pertaining to the exercise of the civil rights of a minor apply, adapted as required, to a person of full age under tutorship.
### Chunk 321

1991, c. 64, a. 287. 288. When instituting the tutorship or subsequently, the court determines whether the rules concerning the capacity of the person of full age under tutorship need to be modified or clarified in light of his faculties. To do so, it takes into consideration the medical and psychosocial assessment reports and, as the case may be, the advice of the tutorship council or of the persons who may be called upon to form the tutorship council. It also takes into account, so far as possible, the opinion of the person of full age.
### Chunk 322

The court then indicates, where applicable, the acts the person under tutorship may perform himself, alone or with the assistance of the tutor, or those he may not perform without being represented. 1991, c. 64, a. 288; 2020, c. 11, s. 50. 289. The person of full age under tutorship retains the administration of the proceeds of his work, unless the court decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 289.

The decisions of the board of directors are taken by the vote of a majority of the directors. 1991, c. 64, a. 336. 337. Every director is, with the other directors, liable for the decisions taken by the board of directors unless he requested that his dissent be recorded in the minutes of proceedings or the equivalent. However, a director who was absent from a meeting of the board is presumed not to have approved the decisions taken at that meeting.
### Chunk 372

1991, c. 64, a. 337. 338. The directors of a legal person are designated by the members. No one may be designated as a director without his express consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 338; I. N. 20151101. 339. The term of office of directors is one year; at the expiry of that period, their term continues unless it is revoked. 1991, c. 64, a. 339. 340. The directors fill the vacancies on the board. Vacancies on the board do not prevent the directors from acting; if their number has become less than a quorum, the remaining directors may validly convene the members.
### Chunk 373

1991, c. 64, a. 340. 341. Where the board is prevented from acting according to majority rule or another specified proportion owing to an impediment or the systematic opposition of some directors, the others may act alone for conservatory acts; they may also, with the authorization of the court, act alone for acts requiring immediate action. Where the situation persists and the administration is seriously impeded as a result, the court, on the application of an interested person, may exempt the directors from acting in the specified proportion, divide their duties, grant a casting vote to one of them or make any order it sees fit in the circumstances.

§ 2. — General meeting 345. The general meeting is convened each year by the board of directors, or following its directives, within six months after the close of the financial period. The first general meeting is held within six months from the constitution of the legal person. 1991, c. 64, a. 345. 346.

### Chunk 377

Ordinary business need not be mentioned in the agenda of the annual meeting. 1991, c. 64, a. 346. 347.

N. 20140501. 352. If they represent 10% of the votes, members may require the directors or the secretary to convene an annual or special general meeting, stating in a written notice the business to be transacted at the meeting. If the directors or the secretary fail to act within 21 days after receiving the notice, any of the members who signed it may convene the meeting.
### Chunk 380

The legal person is bound to reimburse to the members the useful expenses incurred by them to hold the meeting, unless the meeting decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 352; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. § 3. — Provisions common to meetings of directors and general meetings 353. The directors or the members may waive the notice convening a meeting of the board of directors, a general meeting or a meeting of any other organ. The mere presence of the directors or the members is equivalent to a waiver of the convening notice unless they are attending to object that the meeting was not regularly convened.
### Chunk 381

1991, c. 64, a. 353. 354. Resolutions in writing signed by all the persons qualified to vote at a meeting are as valid as if passed at a meeting of the board of directors, at a general meeting or at a meeting of any other organ. A copy of the resolutions is kept with the minutes of proceedings or the equivalent. 1991, c. 64, a. 354. DIVISION II DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION OF LEGAL PERSONS 355. A legal person is dissolved by the annulment of its constituting act or for any other cause provided for by the constituting act or by law.
### Chunk 382

It is also dissolved where the court confirms the fulfilment of the condition attached to the constituting act, the achievement of the object for which the legal person was constituted or the impossibility of achieving it, or the existence of some other legitimate cause. 1991, c. 64, a. 355; I. N. 20151101. 356. A legal person may also be dissolved by consent of not less than twothirds of the votes cast at a general meeting convened expressly for that purpose. The notice convening the meeting shall be sent not less than 30 days but not more than 45 days before the meeting and not at an inopportune moment.
### Chunk 383

1991, c. 64, a. 356; I. N. 20140501. 357. The juridical personality of the legal person continues to exist for the purposes of the liquidation. 1991, c. 64, a. 357. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 96 of 556 ### Page 97 358. The directors shall give notice of the dissolution to the enterprise registrar by filing a declaration to that effect in accordance with the Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (chapter P44. 1) and, if the legal person is a syndicate of coowners, apply for the registration of the notice in the land register.
### Chunk 384

They shall also appoint a liquidator, according to the bylaws, who shall proceed immediately with the liquidation. If the directors fail to fulfil these obligations, they may be held liable for the acts of the legal person, and any interested person may apply to the court for the appointment of a liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 358; 2000, c. 42, s. 2; 2002, c. 45, s. 158; 2010, c. 7, s. 165. 359. Notice of the appointment of a liquidator, as also of any revocation, is filed in the same place and in the same manner as the notice of dissolution.
### Chunk 385

The appointment and revocation may be set up against third persons from the filing of the notice in the enterprise register kept under Chapter II of the Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (chapter P44. 1). 1991, c. 64, a. 359; 2010, c. 7, s. 166; 2010, c. 40, s. 92. 360. The liquidator is seized of the property of the legal person and acts as an administrator of the property of others charged with full administration. The liquidator is entitled to require from the directors and the members of the legal person any document and any explanation concerning the rights and obligations of the legal person.
### Chunk 386

1991, c. 64, a. 360; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 361. The liquidator first repays the debts, then effects the reimbursement of the capital contributions. The liquidator, subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, then partitions the assets among the members in proportion to their rights or, otherwise, in equal portions, following if need be the rules relating to the partition of property in undivided coownership. Any residue devolves to the State. If the assets include property coming from contributions of third persons, the liquidator shall remit such property to another legal person or a trust sharing objectives similar to those of the legal person being liquidated; if that is not possible, it devolves to the State or, if of little value, is shared equally among the members.
### Chunk 387

1991, c. 64, a. 361. 362. The liquidator retains the books and records of the legal person for five years from the closing of the liquidation; he holds them for a longer period if the books and records are required as evidence in proceedings. He disposes of them thereafter as he sees fit. 1991, c. 64, a. 362; I. N. 20140501. 363. Unless the liquidator obtains an extension from the court, the Minister of Revenue undertakes or continues a liquidation that is not terminated within five years from the filing of the notice of dissolution.
### Chunk 388

The Minister of Revenue has, in that case, the same rights and obligations as a liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 363; 2005, c. 44, s. 54. 364. The liquidation of a legal person is closed by the filing of a notice of closure in the same place and in the same manner as the notice of dissolution. The filing of the notice in the register cancels any other registrations concerning the legal person. 1991, c. 64, a. 364; 2010, c. 7, s. 167. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 97 of 556 ### Page 98 BOOK TWO THE FAMILY TITLE ONE MARRIAGE CHAPTER I MARRIAGE AND SOLEMNIZATION OF MARRIAGE 365.
### Chunk 389

Marriage shall be contracted openly, in the presence of two witnesses, before a competent officiant. 1991, c. 64, a. 365; 2002, c. 6, s. 22. 366. Every clerk or deputy clerk of the Superior Court designated by the Minister of Justice, every notary authorized by law to execute notarial acts and, within the territory defined in the instrument of designation, any other person designated by the Minister of Justice, including mayors, members of municipal or borough councils and municipal officers, is competent to solemnize marriage.
### Chunk 390

In addition, every minister of religion authorized to solemnize marriage by the religious society to which he belongs is competent to do so, provided that he is resident in Québec, that he carries on the whole or part of his ministry in Québec, that the existence, rites and ceremonies of his confession are of a permanent nature, that he solemnizes marriages in places which conform to those rites and to the rules prescribed by the Minister of Justice and that he is authorized by the latter. Any minister of religion not resident but living temporarily in Québec may also be authorized to solemnize marriage in Québec for such time as the Minister of Justice determines.
### Chunk 391

In the territory defined in an agreement concluded between the Government and a Mohawk community, the persons designated by the Minister of Justice and the community are also competent to solemnize marriages. 1991, c. 64, a. 366; 1996, c. 21, s. 28; 1999, c. 53, s. 20; 2002, c. 6, s. 23; 2004, c. 5, s. 1; 2007, c. 32, s. 10; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 12, s. 5. 367. No minister of religion may be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which there is any impediment according to his religion and to the discipline of the religious society to which he belongs.
### Chunk 392

1991, c. 64, a. 367. 368. Publication shall be effected by means of a notice posted, for 20 days before the date fixed for the solemnization of the marriage, on the website of the registrar of civil status. No publication is required if the intended spouses are already in a civil union. 1991, c. 64, a. 368; 2004, c. 23, s. 5; 2016, c. 12, s. 6. 369. The publication sets forth the name and domicile of each of the intended spouses, the year and place of their birth, the scheduled solemnization date and the name of the officiant.
### Chunk 393

The correctness of these particulars is confirmed by a witness of full age. The other rules governing publication of the marriage are determined by the Minister of Justice. On receipt of the notice of publication, the registrar of civil status shall ensure that the officiant is competent. 1991, c. 64, a. 369; 2016, c. 12, s. 7. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 98 of 556 ### Page 99 370. The registrar of civil status may, for a serious reason, grant a dispensation from publication on an application by the intended spouses and the officiant.
### Chunk 394

However, if the life of one of the intended spouses is endangered and the marriage must be solemnized promptly without it being possible to obtain a dispensation from the registrar, the officiant may grant the dispensation. In such a case, when sending the declaration of marriage to the registrar of civil status, the officiant shall include the dispensation, which must specify the grounds for granting it. 1991, c. 64, a. 370; 2016, c. 12, s. 8. 371. If a marriage is not solemnized within three months from the twentieth day after publication, the publication shall be renewed.
### Chunk 395

1991, c. 64, a. 371. 372. Any interested person may oppose the solemnization of a marriage between persons incapable of contracting it, in particular if, in the person’s opinion, the consent of one of the intended spouses is likely not to be free or enlightened. A minor may oppose a marriage alone. He may also act alone as defendant. 1991, c. 64, a. 372; 2016, c. 12, s. 9. 373. Before solemnizing a marriage, the officiant ascertains the identity of the intended spouses, compliance with the conditions for the formation of the marriage and observance of formalities prescribed by law.
### Chunk 396

More particularly, the officiant ascertains that the intended spouses are free from any previous bond of marriage or civil union, except in the case of a civil union between the same spouses, and, in the case of minors, that the court has authorized the solemnization of the marriage. The minor may apply alone for the court’s authorization. The person having parental authority or, if applicable, the tutor must be summoned to give his or her advice. 1991, c. 64, a. 373; 2002, c. 6, s.
### Chunk 397

24; 2004, c. 23, s. 6; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 12, s. 10. 374. In the presence of the witnesses, the officiant reads articles 392 to 396 to the intended spouses. He requests and receives, from each of the intended spouses personally, a declaration of their wish to take each other as husband and wife. He then declares them united in marriage. 1991, c. 64, a. 374. 375. The officiant draws up the declaration of marriage and sends it within 30 days after the solemnization to the registrar of civil status.
### Chunk 398

1991, c. 64, a. 375; 1999, c. 47, s. 15; 2016, c. 12, s. 11. 376. Clerks and deputy clerks, notaries and persons designated by the Minister of Justice solemnize marriages according to the rules prescribed by the Minister of Justice. Clerks and deputy clerks collect the duties fixed by regulation of the Government from the intended spouses, on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Notaries and designated persons collect the agreed fees from the intended spouses. However, mayors, other members of municipal or borough councils and municipal officers collect the duties fixed by municipal by CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 99 of 556 ### Page 100 law from the intended spouses, on behalf of the municipality; such duties must be in keeping with the minimum and maximum amounts fixed by regulation of the Government.
### Chunk 399

1991, c. 64, a. 376; 2002, c. 6, s. 25. 376. 1. The rules governing the solemnization of marriage prescribed by the Minister of Justice apply, to the extent determined by the Minister, to the persons authorized by the Minister to solemnize marriages. 2016, c. 12, s. 12. 376. 2. The measures that may be taken in the event of an officiant’s noncompliance with the rules governing the solemnization of marriages are determined by regulation of the Minister of Justice. 2016, c.
### Chunk 400

12, s. 13. 377. Unless the Minister of Justice has already delegated to the registrar of civil status the power to grant the authorizations and make the designations provided for in article 366, the Minister of Justice keeps the registrar informed of the authorizations, designations and revocations the Minister of Justice gives, makes or takes part in with respect to officiants competent to solemnize marriages, so that appropriate entries and corrections may be made in a register. For the same purposes, the secretary of the Ordre des notaires du Québec maintains, and communicates to the registrar of civil status, an updated list of the notaries who are competent to solemnize marriages, specifying the date on which each notary became so competent and, if known, the date on which the notary will cease to be so competent.
### Chunk 401

If an officiant becomes disqualified or dies, the religious society, the clerk of the Superior Court or the secretary of the Ordre des notaires du Québec, as the case may be, is responsible for informing the registrar of civil status so that the appropriate corrections may be made in the register. 1991, c. 64, a. 377; 1996, c. 21, s. 29; 2002, c. 6, s. 26; 2007, c. 32, s. 11; 2016, c. 4, s 47. CHAPTER II PROOF OF MARRIAGE 378. Marriage is proved by an act of marriage, except in cases where the law authorizes another mode of proof.
### Chunk 402

1991, c. 64, a. 378. 379. Possession of the status of spouses compensates for a defect of form in the act of marriage. 1991, c. 64, a. 379. CHAPTER III NULLITY OF MARRIAGE 380. A marriage which is not solemnized as prescribed by this Title and the necessary conditions for its formation may be declared null upon the application of any interested person, although the court may decide according to the circumstances. No action lies after the lapse of three years from the solemnization, except where public order is concerned, in particular if the consent of one of the spouses was not free or enlightened.
### Chunk 403

1991, c. 64, a. 380; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 12, s. 14. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 100 of 556 ### Page 101 381. The nullity of a marriage, for whatever reason, does not deprive the children of the advantages secured to them by law or by the marriage contract. The rights and duties of fathers and mothers or of the parents towards their children are unaffected by the nullity of their marriage. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 404

381; 2022, c. 22, s. 78. 382. A marriage that has been declared null produces its effects in favour of spouses who were in good faith. In particular, the liquidation of the patrimonial rights that are then presumed to have existed is proceeded with, unless the spouses each agree to take back their property. 1991, c. 64, a. 382; I. N. 20140501. 383. If the spouses were in bad faith, they each take back their property. 1991, c. 64, a. 383. 384. If only one spouse was in good faith, that spouse may either take back his or her property or apply for the liquidation of the patrimonial rights resulting to him or her from the marriage.
### Chunk 405

1991, c. 64, a. 384. 385. Subject to article 386, spouses in good faith are entitled to the gifts made to them in consideration of marriage. However, the court may, when declaring a marriage null, declare the gifts to have lapsed or reduce them, or order the payment of the gifts inter vivos deferred for the period of time it fixes, taking the circumstances of the parties into account. 1991, c. 64, a. 385. 386. The nullity of the marriage renders null the gifts inter vivos made in consideration of the marriage to a spouse in bad faith.
### Chunk 406

It also renders null the gifts mortis causa made by one spouse to the other in consideration of the marriage. 1991, c. 64, a. 386. 387. A spouse is presumed to have contracted marriage in good faith unless, when declaring the marriage null, the court declares that spouse to be in bad faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 387. 388. The court decides, as in proceedings for separation from bed and board, as to the provisional measures pending suit, the custody, maintenance and education of the children and, in declaring nullity, it decides as to the right of a spouse in good faith to support or to a compensatory allowance.
### Chunk 407

1991, c. 64, a. 388. 389. Nullity of marriage extinguishes the right which the spouses had to claim support unless, on a demand, the court, in declaring nullity, orders one of them to pay support to the other or, being unable, owing to the circumstances, to decide the question equitably, reserves the right to claim support. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 101 of 556 ### Page 102 The right to claim support may not be reserved for a period of over two years; it is extinguished by operation of law at the expiry of that period.
### Chunk 408

1991, c. 64, a. 389. 390. Where the court has awarded support or reserved the right to claim support, it may at any time after the marriage is annulled declare the right to support extinguished. 1991, c. 64, a. 390. CHAPTER IV EFFECTS OF MARRIAGE 391. In no case may spouses derogate from the provisions of this chapter, whatever their matrimonial regime. 1991, c. 64, a. 391. DIVISION I RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SPOUSES 392. The spouses have the same rights and obligations in marriage.
### Chunk 409

They owe each other respect, fidelity, succour and assistance. They are bound to share a community of life. 1991, c. 64, a. 392; 2016, c. 4, s. 48. 393. In marriage, both spouses retain their respective names, and exercise their respective civil rights under those names. 1991, c. 64, a. 393. 394. The spouses together take in hand the moral and material direction of the family, exercise parental authority and assume the tasks resulting therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 394.
### Chunk 410

395. The spouses choose the family residence together. In the absence of an express choice, the family residence is presumed to be the residence where the members of the family live while carrying on their principal activities. 1991, c. 64, a. 395. 396. The spouses contribute towards the expenses of the marriage in proportion to their respective means. The spouses may make their respective contributions by their activities within the home. 1991, c. 64, a. 396. 397. A spouse who enters into a contract for the current needs of the family also binds the other spouse for the whole, if they are not separated from bed and board.
### Chunk 411

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 102 of 556 ### Page 103 However, the noncontracting spouse is not liable for the debt if he or she had previously informed the other contracting party of his or her unwillingness to be bound. 1991, c. 64, a. 397. 398. Either spouse may give the other a mandate in order to be represented in acts relating to the moral and material direction of the family. This mandate is presumed if one spouse is unable to express his or her will for any reason or if he or she is unable to do so in due time.
### Chunk 412

1991, c. 64, a. 398. 399. Either spouse may be authorized by the court to enter alone into any act for which the consent of the other would be required, provided such consent is unobtainable for any reason, or its refusal is not justified by the interest of the family. The authorization is special and for a specified time; it may be amended or revoked. 1991, c. 64, a. 399. 400. If the spouses disagree as to the exercise of their rights and the performance of their duties, they or either of them may apply to the court, which will decide in the interest of the family after fostering the conciliation of the parties.
### Chunk 413

1991, c. 64, a. 400. DIVISION II FAMILY RESIDENCE 401. Neither spouse may, without the consent of the other, alienate, hypothecate or remove from the family residence the movable property serving for the use of the household. The movable property serving for the use of the household includes only the movable property destined to furnish the family residence or decorate it; decorations include pictures and other works of art, but not collections. 1991, c. 64, a. 401. 402. A spouse having neither consented to nor ratified an act concerning any movable property serving for the use of the household may apply to have it annulled.
### Chunk 414

However, an act by onerous title may not be annulled if the other contracting party was in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 402. 403. Neither spouse, if the lessee of the family residence, may, without the written consent of the other, sublet it, transfer the right or terminate the lease where the lessor has been notified, by either of them, that the dwelling is used as the family residence. A spouse having neither consented to nor ratified the act may apply to have it annulled. 1991, c.
### Chunk 415

64, a. 403. 404. Neither spouse, if the owner of an immovable with fewer than five dwellings that is used in whole or in part as the family residence, may, without the written consent of the other, alienate the immovable, charge it with a real right or lease that part of it reserved for the use of the family. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 103 of 556 ### Page 104 A spouse having neither consented to nor ratified the act may apply to have it annulled if a declaration of family residence was previously registered against the immovable.
### Chunk 416

1991, c. 64, a. 404; I. N. 20140501. 405. Neither spouse, if the owner of an immovable with five dwellings or more that is used in whole or in part as the family residence may, without the written consent of the other, alienate the immovable or lease that part of it reserved for the use of the family. Where a declaration of family residence was previously registered against the immovable, a spouse not having consented to the act of alienation may require from the acquirer the grant of a lease of the premises already occupied as a dwelling, under the conditions governing the lease of a dwelling; on the same condition, a spouse having neither consented to nor ratified the act of lease may apply to have it annulled.
### Chunk 417

1991, c. 64, a. 405; I. N. 20140501. 406. The usufructuary, the emphyteuta and the user are subject to the rules of articles 404 and 405. Neither spouse may, without the consent of the other, dispose of rights held by another title conferring use of the family residence. 1991, c. 64, a. 406; I. N. 20140501. 407. The declaration of family residence is made by both spouses or by either of them. It may also result from a declaration to that effect contained in an act intended for publication.
### Chunk 418

1991, c. 64, a. 407. 408. A spouse not having given consent to an act for which it was required may, without prejudice to any other right, claim damages from the other spouse or from any other person having, through his fault, caused the spouse injury. 1991, c. 64, a. 408; I. N. 20140501. 409. In the event of separation from bed and board, divorce or nullity of a marriage, the court may, upon the application of either spouse, award to the spouse of the lessee the lease of the family residence.
### Chunk 419

The award binds the lessor upon being notified to him and relieves the original lessee of the rights and obligations arising out of the lease from that time forward. 1991, c. 64, a. 409; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 410. In the event of separation from bed and board, or the dissolution or nullity of a marriage, the court may award, to either spouse or to the surviving spouse, the ownership or use of the movable property of the other spouse which serves for the use of the household. It may also award the right of use of the family residence to the spouse to whom it awards custody of a child.
### Chunk 420

The user is exempted from furnishing security and from making an inventory of the property unless the court decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 410; I. N. 20140501. 411. The award of the right of use or ownership is effected, failing agreement between the parties, on the conditions determined by the court and, in particular, on condition of payment of any equalizing sum, all at once or by instalments.

### Chunk 421

1991, c. 64, a. 411; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 49. 412. Judicial award of a right of ownership is subject to the provisions relating to sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 412. 413. A judgment awarding a right of use or ownership is equivalent to title and has the effects thereof. 1991, c. 64, a. 413. DIVISION III FAMILY PATRIMONY § 1. — Establishment of patrimony 414. Marriage entails the establishment of a family patrimony consisting of certain property of the spouses regardless of which of them holds a right of ownership in that property.
### Chunk 422

1991, c. 64, a. 414. 415. The family patrimony is composed of the following property owned by one or the other of the spouses: the residences of the family or the rights which confer use of them, the movable property with which they are furnished or decorated and which serves for the use of the household, the motor vehicles used for family travel and the benefits accrued during the marriage under a retirement plan. The payment of contributions into a pension plan entails an accrual of benefits under the pension plan; so does the accumulation of service recognized for the purposes of a pension plan.
### Chunk 423

This patrimony also includes the registered earnings, during the marriage, of each spouse pursuant to the Act respecting the Québec Pension Plan (chapter R9) or to similar plans. The earnings contemplated in the second paragraph and accrued benefits under a retirement plan governed or established by an Act which grants a right to death benefits to the surviving spouse where the marriage is dissolved as a result of death are, however, excluded from the family patrimony. Property devolved to one of the spouses by succession or gift before or during the marriage is also excluded from the family patrimony.
### Chunk 424

For the purposes of the rules on family patrimony, a retirement plan is any of the following: — a plan governed by the Supplemental Pension Plans Act (chapter R15. 1) or by the Voluntary Retirement Savings Plans Act (chapter R17. 0. 1) or that would be governed by one of those Acts if one of them applied where the spouse works; — a retirement plan governed by a similar Act of a legislative jurisdiction other than the Parliament of Québec; — a plan established by an Act of the Parliament of Québec or of another legislative jurisdiction; — a retirementsavings plan; — any other retirementsavings instrument, including an annuity contract, into which sums from any of such plans have been transferred.
### Chunk 425

1991, c. 64, a. 415; 2002, c. 19, s. 3; 2013, c. 26, s. 128. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 105 of 556 ### Page 106 § 2. — Partition of patrimony 416. In the event of separation from bed and board, or the dissolution or nullity of a marriage, the value of the family patrimony of the spouses, after deducting the debts contracted for the acquisition, improvement, maintenance or preservation of the property composing it, is equally divided between the spouses or between the surviving spouse and the heirs, as the case may be.
### Chunk 426

Where partition is effected upon separation from bed and board, no new partition is effected upon the subsequent dissolution or nullity of the marriage unless the spouses had voluntarily resumed their community of life; where a new partition is effected, the date when the spouses resumed their community of life is substituted for the date of the marriage for the purposes of this section. 1991, c. 64, a. 416; 2016, c. 4, s. 50. 417. The net value of the family patrimony is determined according to the value of the property composing the patrimony and the debts contracted for the acquisition, improvement, maintenance or preservation of the property composing it on the date of death of the spouse or on the date of the institution of the action in which separation from bed and board, divorce or nullity of the marriage, as the case may be, is decided; the property is valued at its market value.
### Chunk 427

The court may, however, upon the application of one or the other of the spouses or of their successors, decide that the net value of the family patrimony will be determined according to the value of such property and such debts on the date when the spouses ceased sharing a community of life. 1991, c. 64, a. 417; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 51. 418. Once the net value of the family patrimony has been determined, a deduction is made from it of the net value, at the time of the marriage, of the property then owned by one of the spouses that is included in the family patrimony; similarly, a deduction is made from it of the net value of a contribution made by one of the spouses during the marriage for the acquisition or improvement of property included in the family patrimony, where the contribution was made out of property devolved by succession or gift, or its reinvestment.
### Chunk 428

A further deduction from the net value is made, in the first case, of the increase in value acquired by the property during the marriage, proportionately to the ratio existing at the time of the marriage between the net value and the gross value of the property, and, in the second case, of the increase in value acquired since the contribution, proportionately to the ratio existing at the time of the contribution between the value of the contribution and the gross value of the property. Reinvestment during the marriage of property included in the family patrimony that was owned at the time of the marriage gives rise to the same deductions, adapted as required.
### Chunk 429

1991, c. 64, a. 418; I. N. 20151101. 419. Partition of the family patrimony is effected by giving in payment or by payment in money. If partition is effected by giving in payment, the spouses may agree to transfer ownership of other property than that composing the family patrimony. 1991, c. 64, a. 419. 420. The court may, at the time of partition, award certain property to one of the spouses and may also, where it is necessary to avoid injury, order the debtor spouse to perform his or her obligation by way of instalments spread over a period of not more than 10 years.
### Chunk 430

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 106 of 556 ### Page 107 It may also order any other measure it considers appropriate to ensure that the judgment is properly executed, and, in particular, order that security be granted to one of the parties to guarantee performance of the obligations of the debtor spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 420; I. N. 20140501. 421. Where property included in the family patrimony was alienated or misappropriated in the year preceding the death of one of the spouses or the institution of proceedings for separation from bed and board, divorce or annulment of marriage and was not replaced, the court may order that a compensatory payment be made to the spouse who would have benefited from the inclusion of that property in the family patrimony.
### Chunk 431

The same rule applies where the property was alienated over one year before the death of one of the spouses or the institution of proceedings and the alienation was made for the purpose of decreasing the share of the spouse who would have benefited from the inclusion of that property in the family patrimony. 1991, c. 64, a. 421. 422. The court may, on an application, make an exception to the rule of partition into equal shares, and decide that there will be no partition of earnings registered pursuant to the Act respecting the Québec Pension Plan (chapter R9) or to similar plans where it would result in an injustice considering, in particular, the brevity of the marriage, the waste of certain property by one of the spouses, or the bad faith of one of them.
### Chunk 432

1991, c. 64, a. 422. 423. The spouses may not, by way of their marriage contract or otherwise, renounce their rights in the family patrimony. A spouse may, however, from the death of the other spouse or from the judgment of divorce, separation from bed and board or nullity of marriage, renounce such rights, in whole or in part, by notarial act en minute; that spouse may also renounce them by a judicial declaration which is recorded, in the course of proceedings for divorce, separation from bed and board or nullity of marriage.
### Chunk 433

Renunciation shall be entered in the register of personal and movable real rights. Failing entry within a period of one year from the time when the right to partition arose, the renouncing spouse is deemed to have accepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 423; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501. 424. Renunciation by one of the spouses, by notarial act, of partition of the family patrimony may be annulled by reason of lesion or any other cause of nullity of contracts. 1991, c. 64, a. 424.
### Chunk 434

425. The partition of the earnings registered in the name of each spouse pursuant to the Act respecting the Québec Pension Plan (chapter R9) or to a similar plan is effected by the body responsible for administering the plan, in accordance with that Act or the Act applicable to that plan, unless the latter Act provides no rules for partition. 1991, c. 64, a. 425. 426. The partition of the accrued benefits of one of the spouses under a pension plan governed or established by an Act is effected according to the rules of valuation and devolution contained in that Act or, where there are no such rules, according to the rules determined by the court seized of the application.
### Chunk 435

In no case, however, may the partition of such benefits deprive the original holder of such benefits of over onehalf of the total value of the benefits accrued to him before or during the marriage, or confer more benefits on the beneficiary of the right to partition than the original holder of these benefits has under his plan. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 107 of 556 ### Page 108 Between the spouses or for their benefit, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, such benefits and benefits accrued under any other pension plan are transferable and seizable for partition of the family patrimony.
### Chunk 436

1991, c. 64, a. 426; 2002, c. 19, s. 4. DIVISION IV COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCE 427. The court, in declaring separation from bed and board, divorce or nullity of marriage, may order either spouse to pay to the other, as compensation for the latter’s contribution, in property or services, to the enrichment of the patrimony of the former, an allowance payable all at once or by instalments, taking into account, in particular, the advantages of the matrimonial regime and of the marriage contract.
### Chunk 437

The same rule applies in case of death; in such a case, the advantages of the succession to the surviving spouse are also taken into account. Where the right to the compensatory allowance is founded on the regular cooperation of the spouse in an enterprise, whether the enterprise deals in property or in services and whether or not it is a commercial enterprise, it may be applied for from the time the cooperation ends, if this results from the alienation, dissolution or voluntary or forced liquidation of the enterprise.
### Chunk 438

1991, c. 64, a. 427; 2016, c. 4, s. 52. 428. The cooperating spouse may adduce any evidence to prove his or her contribution to the enrichment of the patrimony of the other spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 428. 429. Where a compensatory allowance is to be paid, the court, failing agreement between the parties, fixes the amount thereof. It may also, where applicable, fix the terms and conditions of payment and order that the allowance be paid all at once or by instalments or that it be paid by the awarding of rights in certain property.
### Chunk 439

If the court awards a right in the family residence, a right in the movable property serving for the use of the household or retirement benefits accrued under a retirement plan to one of the spouses or to the surviving spouse, the provisions of Sections II and III are applicable. 1991, c. 64, a. 429; 2016, c. 4, s 53. 430. One of the spouses may, during the marriage, agree with the other spouse to make partial payment of the compensatory allowance. The payment received shall be deducted when the time comes to fix the value of the compensatory allowance.

1991, c. 64, a. 430. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 108 of 556 ### Page 109 CHAPTER V MATRIMONIAL REGIMES DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1. — Choice of matrimonial regime 431. Any kind of stipulation may be made in a marriage contract, subject to the imperative provisions of law and public order. 1991, c. 64, a. 431. 432. Spouses who, before the solemnization of their marriage, have not fixed their matrimonial regime in a marriage contract, are subject to the regime of partnership of acquests.
### Chunk 441

1991, c. 64, a. 432. 433. A matrimonial regime, whether legal or conventional, takes effect on the day when the marriage is solemnized. A change made to the matrimonial regime during the marriage takes effect on the day of the act attesting the change. In no case may the parties stipulate that their matrimonial regime or any change to it will take effect on another date. 1991, c. 64, a. 433. 434. A minor authorized to marry may, before the marriage is solemnized, make all such matrimonial agreements as the marriage contract admits of, provided he is authorized to that effect by the court.
### Chunk 442

The person having parental authority or, as the case may be, the tutor shall be summoned to give his advice. The minor may apply for the authorization alone. 1991, c. 64, a. 434; I. N. 20140501. 435. Agreements not authorized by the court may be impugned only by the minor or by the persons who had to be summoned to give their advice; no such agreement may be impugned if one year has elapsed since the marriage was solemnized. 1991, c. 64, a. 435; I. N. 20140501. 436. No person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate may make matrimonial agreements without the assistance of his tutor or mandatary; the tutor or mandatary shall be authorized for this purpose by the court, if applicable, upon the advice of the tutorship council.
### Chunk 443

No agreement made in violation of this article may be impugned except by the person of full age himself, his tutor or his mandatary, as the case may be, nor except in the year immediately following the solemnization of the marriage or the day of the act changing the matrimonial agreements. 1991, c. 64, a. 436; 2020, c. 11, s. 61. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 109 of 556 ### Page 110 437. Intended spouses may change their matrimonial agreements before the solemnization of the marriage, in the presence and with the consent of all those who were parties to the marriage contract, provided the changes themselves are made by marriage contract.
### Chunk 444

1991, c. 64, a. 437. 438. During marriage, spouses may change their matrimonial regime and any stipulation in their marriage contract, provided the change itself is made by marriage contract. Gifts made in marriage contracts, including gifts mortis causa, may be changed even if they are stipulated as irrevocable, provided that the consent of all interested persons is obtained. If a creditor suffers injury as the result of a change to a marriage contract, he may, within one year of becoming aware of the change, obtain a declaration that it may not be set up against him.
### Chunk 445

1991, c. 64, a. 438; I. N. 20140501. 439. Children to be born are represented by the spouses for the modification or cancellation, before or during the marriage, of gifts made to them by the marriage contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 439. 440. Marriage contracts shall be established by a notarial act en minute, on pain of absolute nullity. 1991, c. 64, a. 440. 441. The notary executing a marriage contract changing a previous contract shall immediately notify the depositary of the original marriage contract and the depositary of any contract changing the matrimonial regime.
### Chunk 446

The depositary is bound to enter the change on the contract and on any copy he may make of it, indicating the date of the contract, the name of the notary and its minute number. The notation of the change may be made on the contract or, if applicable, on a copy of it or on a writing attached to the contract or copy, directly or by a reference. 1991, c. 64, a. 441; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 23, s. 1. 442. A notice of every marriage contract shall be entered in the register of personal and movable real rights at the requisition of the officiating notary.
### Chunk 447

1991, c. 64, a. 442; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Exercise of rights and powers arising out of the matrimonial regime 443. Either spouse may give a mandate to the other in order to be represented in the exercise of rights and powers granted by the matrimonial regime. 1991, c. 64, a. 443. 444. Where an expression of will cannot be given or cannot be given in due time by one spouse, the court may confer a mandate upon the other spouse to administer the property of that spouse or property administered by that spouse under the matrimonial regime.
### Chunk 448

The court fixes the terms and conditions of exercise of the powers conferred. 1991, c. 64, a. 444. 445. The court may declare the judicial mandate withdrawn once it is established that it is no longer necessary. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 110 of 556 ### Page 111 The mandate ceases by operation of law upon tutorship being instituted or a protection mandate homologated for the other spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 445; 2020, c. 11, s. 62.
### Chunk 449

446. Either spouse, having administered the property of the other, is accountable even for the fruits and revenues consumed before being in default for failing to render an account. 1991, c. 64, a. 446; I. N. 20151101. 447. If one spouse exceeds the powers granted by the matrimonial regime and the other has not ratified the act, the latter may apply to have it declared null. As regards movable property, however, each spouse is deemed, with respect to third persons in good faith, to have power to enter alone into acts by onerous title for which the consent of the other spouse would be necessary.
### Chunk 450

1991, c. 64, a. 447; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II PARTNERSHIP OF ACQUESTS § 1. — Composition of the partnership of acquests 448. The property that each of the spouses possesses when the regime comes into effect or that each subsequently acquires constitutes acquests or private property according to the rules that follow. 1991, c. 64, a. 448; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 54. 449. The acquests of each spouse include all property not declared to be private property by law, and, in particular, (1) the proceeds of that spouse’s work during the regime; (2) the fruits and income due or collected from all that spouse’s private property or acquests during the regime.
### Chunk 451

1991, c. 64, a. 449. 450. The private property of each spouse consists of (1) property owned or possessed by that spouse when the regime comes into effect; (2) property which devolves to that spouse during the regime by succession or gift, and the fruits and income derived from it if the testator or donor has so provided; (3) property acquired by that spouse to replace private property and any insurance indemnity relating thereto; (4) the rights or benefits devolved to that spouse as a subrogated holder or as a specified beneficiary under a contract or plan of retirement, other annuity or insurance of persons; (5) that spouse’s clothing and personal papers, wedding ring, decorations and diplomas; (6) the instruments required for that spouse’s occupation, saving compensation where applicable.

1991, c. 64, a. 450. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 111 of 556 ### Page 112 451. Property acquired with private property and acquests is also private property, subject to compensation, if the value of the private property used is greater than onehalf of the total cost of acquisition of the property. Otherwise, it is an acquest subject to compensation. The same rule applies to life insurance, retirement pensions and other annuities. The total cost is the aggregate of the premiums or sums paid, except in term insurance where it is the amount of the latest premium.
### Chunk 453

1991, c. 64, a. 451. 452. Where, during the regime, a spouse who is already a coowner in indivision of property, held as private property, acquires another part of it, this acquired part is also that spouse’s private property, saving compensation where applicable. However, if the value of the acquests used to acquire that part is equal to or greater than onehalf of the total value of the property of which the spouse has become the owner, this property becomes an acquest, subject to compensation.
### Chunk 454

1991, c. 64, a. 452; I. N. 20140501. 453. The right of a spouse to support, to a disability pension or to any other benefit of the same nature remains the private property of that spouse; however, all pecuniary benefits derived from these are acquests, if they fall due or are collected during the regime or are payable to that spouse’s heirs and successors at death. No compensation is due by reason of any amount or premium paid with the acquests or the private property to acquire the support, allowance or other benefits.
### Chunk 455

1991, c. 64, a. 453; I. N. 20140501. 454. The right to claim damages and the compensation received for moral or bodily injury are also the private property of the spouse. The same rule applies to the right and the compensation arising from an insurance contract or any other indemnification scheme, but no compensation is due by reason of the premiums or amounts paid with the acquests. 1991, c. 64, a. 454; I. N. 20140501. 455. Property acquired as an accessory of or an annex to private property, and any construction, work or plantation on or in an immovable which is private property, remain private, saving compensation, if need be.
### Chunk 456

However, if the accessory or annex was acquired, or the construction, work or plantation made, from acquests, and if its value is equal to or greater than that of the private property, the whole becomes an acquest subject to compensation. 1991, c. 64, a. 455. 456. Securities acquired by the effect of a declaration of dividends on securities that are the private property of either spouse remain that spouse’s private property, saving compensation. Securities acquired by the effect of the exercise of a subscription right, a preemptive right or any other similar right conferred on either spouse by securities that are that spouse’s private property likewise remain so, saving compensation, if need be.
### Chunk 457

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 112 of 556 ### Page 113 Redemption premiums and prepaid premiums on securities that are the private property of either spouse remain that spouse’s private property without compensation. 1991, c. 64, a. 456. 457. Income derived from the operation of an enterprise that is the private property of either spouse remains that spouse’s private property, subject to compensation, if it is reinvested in the enterprise.
### Chunk 458

No compensation is due, however, if the investment was necessary in order to maintain the income of the enterprise. 1991, c. 64, a. 457; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 458. Intellectual and industrial property rights are private property, but all fruits and income arising from them and collected or fallen due during the regime are acquests. 1991, c. 64, a. 458. 459. All property is presumed to constitute an acquest, both between the spouses and with respect to third persons, unless it is established that it is private property.
### Chunk 459

1991, c. 64, a. 459. 460. Any property that a spouse is unable to prove to be his or her exclusive private property or acquest is presumed to be held by both spouses in undivided coownership, onehalf by each. 1991, c. 64, a. 460; 2016, c. 4, s. 55. § 2. — Administration of property and liability for debts 461. Each spouse has the administration, enjoyment and free disposal of his or her private property and acquests. 1991, c. 64, a. 461. 462. Neither spouse may, however, without the consent of the other, dispose of acquests inter vivos by gratuitous title, with the exception of property of small value or customary presents.
### Chunk 460

A spouse may be authorized by the court to enter into the act alone, however, if consent cannot be obtained for any reason or if refusal is not justified in the interest of the family. 1991, c. 64, a. 462. 463. The restriction to the right to dispose of acquests does not limit the right of either spouse to designate a third person as a beneficiary or subrogated holder of an insurance of persons, a retirement pension or any other annuity, subject to the application of the rules concerning the family patrimony.
### Chunk 461

No compensation is due by reason of the sums or premiums paid with the acquests if the designation is in favour of the other spouse or of the children of either spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 463; I. N. 20140501. 464. The spouses, individually, are liable on both their private property and their acquests for all debts incurred by them before or during the marriage. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 113 of 556 ### Page 114 While the regime lasts, neither spouse is liable for the debts incurred by the other, subject to articles 397 and 398.
### Chunk 462

1991, c. 64, a. 464. § 3. — Dissolution and liquidation of the regime 465. The regime of partnership of acquests is dissolved by (1) the death of one of the spouses; (2) a conventional change of regime during the marriage; (3) a judgment of divorce, separation from bed and board, or separation as to property; (4) the absence of one of the spouses in the cases provided for by law; (5) the nullity of the marriage if, nevertheless, the marriage produces effects. The effects of the dissolution are produced immediately, except in the cases of subparagraphs 3 and 5, where they are retroactive, between the spouses, to the day of the application.
### Chunk 463

1991, c. 64, a. 465. 466. In any case of dissolution of a regime, the court may, upon the application of either spouse or of the latter’s successors, decide that, in the relations between the spouses, the effects of the dissolution are retroactive to the date when they ceased sharing a community of life. 1991, c. 64, a. 466; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 56. 467. Each spouse retains his or her private property after the regime is dissolved. One spouse may accept or renounce the partition of the other spouse’s acquests, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.
### Chunk 464

1991, c. 64, a. 467. 468. Acceptance may be either express or tacit. A spouse who has interfered in the management of the acquests of the other spouse after the regime is dissolved may not receive the share of the acquests of the other spouse to which he or she is entitled unless the other spouse has accepted the partition of the acquests of the spouse who interfered. Acts of simple administration do not constitute interference. 1991, c. 64, a. 468; I. N. 20140501. 469. Renunciation shall be made by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded.
### Chunk 465

Renunciation shall be entered in the register of personal and movable real rights; failing entry within one year from the date of the dissolution, the spouse is deemed to have accepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 469. 470. If either spouse renounces partition, the share of the other’s acquests to which he or she would have been entitled remains vested in the other. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 114 of 556 ### Page 115 However, the creditors of the spouse who renounces partition to the prejudice of their rights may apply to the court for a declaration that the renunciation may not be set up against them, and accept the share of the acquests of their debtor’s spouse in his or her place and stead.
### Chunk 466

In that case, their acceptance has effect only in their favour and only to the extent of the amount of their claims; it is not valid in favour of the renouncing spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 470. 471. A spouse who has misappropriated or concealed acquests, wasted his or her acquests or administered them in bad faith forfeits his or her share of the acquests of the other spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 471; 2016, c. 4, s. 57. 472. Acceptance and renunciation are irrevocable. Renunciation may be annulled, however, by reason of lesion or any other cause of nullity of contracts.
### Chunk 467

1991, c. 64, a. 472. 473. When the regime is dissolved by death and the surviving spouse has accepted the partition of the acquests of the deceased spouse, the heirs of the deceased spouse may accept or renounce the partition of the surviving spouse’s acquests, and, excepting preferential awards which only the surviving spouse is entitled to receive, the provisions on the dissolution and liquidation of the regime apply to them. If one of the heirs accepts partition and the others renounce it, the heir who accepts may not take more than the portion of the acquests that he would have had if all had accepted.
### Chunk 468

Renunciation by the surviving spouse may be set up against the creditors of the deceased spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 473. 474. When a spouse dies while still entitled to renounce partition, the heirs have a further period of one year from the date of death in which to have their renunciation registered. 1991, c. 64, a. 474; I. N. 20140501. 475. When the partition of a spouse’s acquests is accepted, the property of the patrimony of that spouse is first divided into two masses, one comprising the private property and the other the acquests.
### Chunk 469

A statement is then prepared of the compensation owed by the mass of private property to the mass of the spouse’s acquests, and vice versa. The compensation is equal to the enrichment enjoyed by one mass to the detriment of the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 475. 476. Property susceptible of compensation is assessed according to its condition at the time of dissolution of the regime and to its value at the time of liquidation. The enrichment is valued as on the day the regime is dissolved; however, when the property acquired or improved was alienated during the regime, the enrichment is valued as on the day of the alienation.
### Chunk 470

1991, c. 64, a. 476; I. N. 20140501. 477. No compensation is due by reason of disbursements necessary or useful for the maintenance or preservation of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 477; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 115 of 556 ### Page 116 478. Unpaid debts incurred for the benefit of the private property give rise to compensation as if they had already been paid with the acquests. 1991, c. 64, a. 478. 479.
### Chunk 471

Payment with the acquests of any fine imposed by law gives rise to compensation. 1991, c. 64, a. 479. 480. If the statement shows a balance in favour of the mass of acquests, the spouse who holds the patrimony makes a return to that mass for partition, either by taking less, or in value, or with his or her private property. If the statement shows a balance in favour of the mass of private property, the spouse removes assets from his or her acquests up to the amount owed. 1991, c.
### Chunk 472

64, a. 480. 481. Once the settlement of compensation has been effected, the net value of the mass of acquests is determined and evenly divided between the spouses. The spouse who holds the patrimony may pay the portion due to the other spouse by paying him or her in money or by giving in payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 481; I. N. 20151101. 482. If the dissolution of the regime results from the death or absence of the spouse who holds the patrimony, the other spouse may require to be given in payment, on condition of payment of any equalizing sum, all at once or by instalments, the family residence and the movable property serving for the use of the household or any other family property to the extent that they were acquests or property forming part of the family patrimony.
### Chunk 473

If there is no agreement on the payment of the equalizing sum, the court fixes the terms and conditions of guarantee and payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 482; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 58. 483. If the parties do not agree on the valuation of the property, it is valued by experts designated by the parties or, failing them, the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 483. 484. Before the partition, dissolution of the regime does not prejudice the rights of preexisting creditors against the whole of their debtor’s patrimony.
### Chunk 474

After the partition, the preexisting creditors may only pursue payment of their claims against the debtor spouse. However, if the claims were not taken into account when the partition was made, they may, after discussion of the property of their debtor, pursue the other spouse. Each spouse then retains a remedy against the other for the amounts he or she would have been entitled to if the claims had been paid before the partition. In no case may the spouse of the debtor spouse be called upon to pay a greater amount than the portion of the acquests he or she received from the latter.

The regime of conventional separation as to property is established by a simple declaration to this effect in the marriage contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 485. 486. Under the regime of separation as to property, each spouse has the administration, enjoyment and free disposal of all his or her property.
### Chunk 476

1991, c. 64, a. 486; I. N. 20140501. 487. Property over which the spouses are unable to establish their exclusive right of ownership is presumed to be held by both in undivided coownership, onehalf by each. 1991, c. 64, a. 487. § 2. — Judicial separation as to property 488. Either spouse may seek separation as to property when the application of the rules of the matrimonial regime proves to be contrary to the interests of that spouse or of the family. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 477

488; I. N. 20140501. 489. Separation as to property judicially obtained entails dissolution of the matrimonial regime and puts the spouses in the situation of those who are conventionally separate as to property. Between spouses, the effects of the separation are retroactive to the day of the application unless the court makes them retroactive to the date on which the spouses ceased sharing a community of life. 1991, c. 64, a. 489; 2016, c. 4, s. 60. 490. Creditors of the spouses may not apply for separation as to property, but may intervene in the action.
### Chunk 478

They may also institute proceedings against separation as to property pronounced or executed in fraud of their rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 490. 491. Dissolution of the matrimonial regime effected by separation as to property does not give rise to the rights of survivorship, unless otherwise stipulated in the marriage contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 491. DIVISION IV COMMUNITY REGIMES 492. Where the spouses elect for a community matrimonial regime and it is necessary to supplement the provisions of the agreement, reference shall be made to the rules of partnership of acquests, adapted as required.

### Chunk 480

1991, c. 64, a. 493; 2016, c. 4, s. 61. 494. The will to share a community of life is gravely undermined particularly (1) where proof of an accumulation of facts making the continuation of community of life hardly tolerable is adduced by the spouses or either of them; (2) where, at the time of the application, the spouses are living apart; (3) where either spouse has seriously failed to perform an obligation resulting from the marriage; however, the spouse may not invoke his or her own failure.
### Chunk 481

1991, c. 64, a. 494; 2016, c. 4, s. 62. 495. If the spouses submit to the approval of the court a draft agreement settling the consequences of their separation from bed and board, they may apply for separation without disclosing the ground. The court then grants the separation if it is satisfied that the spouses truly consent and that the agreement sufficiently preserves the interests of each of them and of the children. 1991, c. 64, a. 495. DIVISION II PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPARATION FROM BED AND BOARD § 1.
### Chunk 482

— General provision 496.

N. 20140501. § 2. — Application and proof 497. An application for separation from bed and board may be presented by both spouses or either of them. 1991, c. 64, a. 497. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 118 of 556 ### Page 119 498.
### Chunk 483

Proof that the continuation of community of life is hardly tolerable may result from the testimony of one party but the court may require additional proof. 1991, c. 64, a. 498; 2016, c. 4, s. 63. § 3. — Provisional measures 499. An application for separation from bed and board releases the spouses from the obligation to share a community of life. 1991, c. 64, a. 499; 2016, c. 4, s. 64. 500. The court may order either spouse to leave the family residence during the proceedings.
### Chunk 484

It may also authorize either spouse to retain temporarily certain movable property which until that time had served for common use. 1991, c. 64, a. 500. 501. The court may decide as to the custody and education of the children. It fixes the contribution of each spouse to the maintenance of the children during the proceedings. 1991, c. 64, a. 501; I. N. 20140501. 502. The court may order either spouse to pay support to the other, and a provision to cover the costs of the proceedings.

The court may adjourn the hearing of the application for separation from bed and board if it considers that adjournment can foster the reconciliation of the spouses or avoid serious injury to either spouse or to any of their children. The court may also adjourn the hearing if it considers that the spouses are able to settle the consequences of their separation from bed and board and to make agreements in that respect which the court will be able to take into account.
### Chunk 486

1991, c. 64, a. 504; I. N. 20140501. 505. Reconciliation between the spouses occurring after the application is presented terminates the proceedings. Either spouse may nevertheless present a new application on any ground arising after the reconciliation and, in that case, may invoke the previous grounds in support of the application. 1991, c. 64, a. 505. 506.

Separation from bed and board carries with it separation as to property, where applicable.

Separation from bed and board does not immediately give rise to rights of survivorship, unless otherwise stipulated in the marriage contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 509. 510. Separation from bed and board does not entail the lapse of gifts made to the spouses in consideration of marriage. However, the court, when granting a separation, may declare the gifts lapsed or reduce them, or order the payment of gifts inter vivos deferred for such time as it may fix, taking the circumstances of the parties into account.
### Chunk 489

1991, c. 64, a. 510. 511. The court, when granting a separation from bed and board or subsequently, may order either spouse to pay support to the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 511. 512. In any decision relating to the effects of separation from bed and board as regards the spouses, the court takes their circumstances into account; it considers, among other things, their needs and means, the agreements made between them, their age and state of health, their family obligations, their chances of finding employment, their existing and foreseeable patrimonial situation, evaluating both their capital and their income, and, as the case may be, the time needed by the creditor of support to acquire sufficient autonomy.

A civil union is a commitment by two persons 18 years of age or over who express their free and enlightened consent to share a community of life and to uphold the rights and obligations that derive from that status. A civil union may only be contracted between persons who are free from any previous bond of marriage or civil union and who in relation to each other are neither an ascendant or a descendant, nor a brother or a sister.

### Chunk 499

6, s. 27. 521. 6. The spouses in a civil union have the same rights and obligations. They owe each other respect, fidelity, succour and assistance. They are bound to share a community of life. The effects of the civil union as regards the direction of the family, the exercise of parental authority, contribution towards expenses, the family residence, the family patrimony and the compensatory allowance are the same as the effects of marriage, with the necessary modifications. Whatever their civil union regime, the spouses may not derogate from the provisions of this article.

2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 12, s. 16. 521. 11. The nullity of a civil union entails the same effects as the nullity of a marriage. 2002, c. 6, s. 27. CHAPTER IV DISSOLUTION OF CIVIL UNION 2002, c. 6, s. 27. 521. 12. A civil union is dissolved by the death of either spouse. It is also dissolved by a court judgment or by a joint notarial declaration where the spouses’ will to share a community of life is irretrievably undermined. A civil union is also dissolved by the marriage of the spouses to one another.
### Chunk 504

The sole consequence of the dissolution is the severing of the bond of civil union. The effects of the civil union are maintained and are considered to be effects of the marriage from the date of the civil union, and the civil union regime of the spouses becomes the matrimonial regime, unless they have made changes to it by marriage contract. 2002, c. 6, s. 27; 2004, c. 23, s. 7; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 73. 521. 13. The spouses may consent, by way of a joint declaration, to the dissolution of the civil union provided they settle all the consequences of the dissolution in an agreement.
### Chunk 505

The declaration and the agreement must be executed before a notary and recorded in notarial acts en minute. The notary may not execute the declaration before the agreement is recorded in a notarial transaction contract. The notary must inform the spouses beforehand of the consequences of the dissolution and make sure that they truly consent to the dissolution and that the agreement is not contrary to imperative provisions of law or public order. If he considers it appropriate, the notary may inform the spouses of services of which he is aware that are likely to foster their conciliation.

2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 74. 521. 14. The transaction contract specifies the date on which the net value of the family patrimony is determined. The date may not be earlier than the date of the joint proceeding for the dissolution of the civil union or the date on which the spouses ceased their community of life, or later than the date of the execution of the contract before a notary. 2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c.
### Chunk 507

4, s. 75. 521. 15. The joint declaration dissolving a civil union states the names and domicile of the spouses, their places and dates of birth and the place and date of solemnization of the union; it also indicates the places and dates of execution of the transaction contract and of the declaration as well as the minute number given to each of those acts. 2002, c. 6, s. 27. 521. 16. From the date of their execution before a notary and without further formality, the joint declaration dissolving the civil union and the transaction contract have the effects of a judgment dissolving a civil union.

The depositary is bound to make a reference to the joint declaration of dissolution on the contract and on any copy issued, specifying the date of the declaration, the minute number and the name and address of the notary who executed the declaration.
### Chunk 509

Such a notation of the reference may be made on the contract or, if applicable, on a copy of it or on a writing attached to the contract or copy, directly or by a reference. The notarial declaration and transaction must also be sent to Retraite Québec. A notice of the notarial declaration must be entered in the register of personal and movable real rights on the application of the officiating notary. 2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20140501; I.

### Chunk 510

23, s. 2. 521. 17. In the absence of a joint declaration dissolving the civil union executed before a notary or where the interests of the common children of the spouses are at stake, the dissolution of the union must be pronounced by the court. The court must ascertain that the spouses’ will to share a community of life is irretrievably undermined, foster conciliation and see to the interests of the children and the respect of their rights. During the proceeding, the court may determine provisional measures, as in the case of separation from bed and board.
### Chunk 511

Upon or after pronouncing the dissolution, the court may order one of the spouses to pay support to the other and decide as to the custody, maintenance and education of the children, in their interest and the respect of their rights, taking into account, where appropriate, any agreements made between the spouses. 2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 76. 521. 18. The dissolution of a civil union does not deprive the children of the advantages secured to them by law or by the civil union contract.
### Chunk 512

The rights and duties of parents towards their children are unaffected by the dissolution of the union. 2002, c. 6, s. 27; I. N. 20140501. 521. 19. The dissolution of a civil union entails the dissolution of the civil union regime. Between the spouses, the effects of the dissolution of the regime are retroactive to the day of the death, the day of execution of the joint declaration of dissolution before a notary or, if the spouses so stipulated in the notarial transaction, the day on which the net value of the family patrimony is determined.
### Chunk 513

If the dissolution is pronounced by the court, its effects are retroactive to the day of the application to the court, unless the court makes them retroactive to the day on which the spouses ceased sharing a community of life. Dissolution, otherwise than by death, entails the lapse of gifts mortis causa made by one spouse to the other in consideration of the civil union. It does not entail the lapse of other gifts mortis causa or of gifts inter vivos between the spouses in consideration of the union, except that the court may, upon pronouncing the dissolution, declare such gifts lapsed or reduce them, or order the payment of gifts inter vivos deferred for such time as it may fix.

The same applies where the father and mother or the parents of the same child become de facto spouses or become de facto spouses again.
### Chunk 515

Where one of the spouses is married or in a civil union or a parental union, a parental union with a new spouse is formed only from the date of the dissolution of the marriage or civil union or, as the case may be, of the end of the parental union. Persons who are, in relation to each other, an ascendant, a descendant, a brother or a sister cannot form a parental union. Within the meaning of this article, de facto spouses are two persons who share a community of life and who represent themselves publicly as a couple, regardless of how long they have shared a community of life.
### Chunk 516

Parental union entails the establishment of a parental union patrimony consisting of certain property of the spouses regardless of which of them holds a right of ownership in that property. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 30. The parental union patrimony is composed, upon its establishment, of the following property owned by one or the other of the spouses: the residences of the family or the rights which confer use of them, the movable property with which they are furnished or decorated and which serves for the use of the household, and the motor vehicles used for family travel.
### Chunk 522

Property devolved to one of the spouses by succession or gift before or during the union is, however, excluded from the parental union patrimony. The same applies to the property of a spouse who is a minor, which property is to be included in the parental union patrimony only once the spouse attains full age. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 31. The spouses may, during the union, change the composition of the parental union patrimony. Any change whose purpose is to exclude property referred to in the first paragraph of article 521.
### Chunk 523

30 from the parental union patrimony must be attested to, on pain of absolute nullity, by notarial act en minute. The change takes effect on the day of the act attesting the change. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 128 of 556 ### Page 129 521. 32. No person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate may enter into an agreement concerning the parental union patrimony without the assistance of the person’s tutor or mandatary; the tutor or mandatary must be authorized for this purpose by the court, if applicable, upon the advice of the tutorship council.
### Chunk 524

No agreement entered into in violation of this article may be impugned except by the person of full age himself or by the person’s tutor or mandatary, as the case may be, nor except in the year immediately following the signing of the agreement. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 33. The spouses may, during the union, by notarial act en minute, on pain of absolute nullity, withdraw by mutual agreement from the application of the provisions of this chapter. The withdrawal takes effect on the day of the act attesting the withdrawal.
### Chunk 525

Where the withdrawal is attested to within 90 days of the beginning of the union, the parental union patrimony is deemed never to have been established. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 DIVISION II PARTITION OF PARENTAL UNION PATRIMONY 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 34. Upon the end of the parental union, where the spouses withdraw from the application of the provisions of this chapter or where a judgment enabling the liquidation of the patrimonial rights of an absentee spouse is rendered, the value of the parental union patrimony, after deducting the debts contracted for the acquisition, improvement, maintenance or preservation of the property composing it, is equally divided between the spouses or between the surviving spouse and the heirs, as the case may be.
### Chunk 526

2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 35. The net value of the parental union patrimony is determined according to the market value, on the date on which the right to partition arises, of the property composing it and of the debts contracted for the acquisition, improvement, maintenance or preservation of the property. The net value of the parental union patrimony also includes the net value of the property referred to in the first paragraph of article 521. 30, but that was excluded from the patrimony by the spouses.
### Chunk 527

The net value of that property is determined at the time of the exclusion. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 36. Once the net value of the parental union patrimony has been determined, a deduction is made from it of the net value, at the time it was included in the patrimony, of the property that was then owned by CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 129 of 556 ### Page 130 one of the spouses and that forms part of the patrimony, as well as of the increase in value acquired by the property while forming part of the patrimony, proportionately to the ratio existing, at the time it was included in the patrimony, between the net value and the gross value of the property.
### Chunk 528

A further deduction from the net value of the parental union patrimony is made of the net value of the contribution made by one of the spouses for the acquisition or improvement of property in the patrimony while that property forms part of the patrimony as well as of the increase in value acquired since the contribution, proportionately to the ratio existing, at the time of the contribution, between the value of the contribution and the gross value of the property, where the contribution was made out of (1) the property accumulated before the establishment of the parental union patrimony and that does not form part of it; (2) the property of a spouse who is a minor accumulated before the spouse attains full age and that does not form part of the parental union patrimony; (3) the property devolved by succession or gift before or during the union; or (4) the fruits and revenues derived from the property referred to in subparagraphs 1 to 3.
### Chunk 529

Reinvestment, during the union, of property referred to in this article gives rise to the same deductions, with the necessary modifications. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 37. Partition of the parental union patrimony is effected by payment in money or by giving in payment. If partition is effected by giving in payment, the spouses may agree to transfer ownership of other property than that composing the parental union patrimony. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521.
### Chunk 530

38. The court may, at the time of partition, award certain property to one of the spouses and may also, where it is necessary to avoid injury, order the debtor spouse to perform his or her obligation by way of instalments spread over a period of not more than 10 years. It may also order any other measure it considers appropriate to ensure that the judgment is properly executed, and, in particular, order that security be granted to one of the parties to guarantee performance of the obligations of the debtor spouse.
### Chunk 531

2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 39. Where property that formed part of the parental union patrimony was alienated or misappropriated in the year preceding the time at which the right to partition arose and where that property was not replaced, the court may order that a compensatory payment be made to the spouse who would have benefited from the inclusion of that property in the parental union patrimony. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 130 of 556 ### Page 131 The same applies where the property was alienated over one year before the right to partition arose and where the alienation was made for the purpose of decreasing the share of the spouse who would have benefited from the inclusion of that property in the parental union patrimony.
### Chunk 532

2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 40. The court may, on an application, make an exception to the rule of partition into equal shares where it would result in an injustice considering, in particular, the brevity of the parental union, the waste of certain property by one of the spouses, or the bad faith of one of them. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 41. A spouse may, from the end of the union, renounce partition of the parental union patrimony in whole or in part; the spouse may renounce partition only by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded, in the course of an application in a family matter.
### Chunk 533

Renunciation must be entered in the register of personal and movable real rights. Failing entry within a period of one year from the day the union ended, the renouncing spouse is deemed to have accepted. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 42. Renunciation by one of the spouses, by notarial act, may be annulled by reason of lesion or any other cause of nullity of contracts. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 CHAPTER IV COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCE 2024, c. 22, s. 3.
### Chunk 534

In force: 20250630 521. 43. A spouse may, from the end of the parental union, apply to the court for an order directing the other spouse to pay to the former, as compensation for the impoverishment attributable to that spouse’s contribution, in property or services, to the enrichment of the patrimony of the other spouse, an allowance payable all at once or by instalments, taking into account, in particular, the advantages of the parental union patrimony. The same rule applies in case of death; in such a case, the advantages of the succession to the surviving spouse are also taken into account.
### Chunk 535

Where the right to the compensatory allowance is founded on the regular cooperation of the spouse in an enterprise, whether the enterprise deals in property or in services and whether or not it is a commercial enterprise, it may be applied for from the time the cooperation ends, if it ends due to the alienation, dissolution or voluntary or forced liquidation of the enterprise. 2024, c. 22, s. 3.

44. Proof of a spouse’s impoverishment and contribution to the enrichment of the other spouse’s patrimony may be made by any means. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 45. The court may award a provision to the spouse applying for a compensatory allowance to cover the costs of the proceedings. 2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 46. Where a compensatory allowance is to be paid, the court, failing agreement between the parties, establishes its value based on the lesser of the value of the spouse’s impoverishment attributable to the latter’s contribution or the value of the enrichment of the other spouse.
### Chunk 537

The court may also, where applicable, fix the terms and conditions of payment and order that the allowance be paid all at once or by instalments or that it be paid by the awarding of rights in certain property. If the court awards a right in the family residence or a right in the movable property serving for the use of the household to one of the spouses or to the surviving spouse, the provisions of chapters II and III of this Title apply. The Minister of Justice may, by regulation, determine standards for establishing the values of the impoverishment and of the enrichment.
### Chunk 538

2024, c. 22, s. 3. In force: 20250630 521. 47. Either spouse may, during the union, agree with the other spouse to make partial payment of the compensatory allowance. The payment received must be deducted when the time comes to establish the value of the compensatory allowance. 2024, c. 22, s. 3.

2023, c. 13, s. 9. DIVISION II FILIATION BY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OR BY BLOOD 2023, c. 13, s. 9. 523. The filiation of a child is established with regard to the mother or parent by the fact of their having given birth to him and, with regard to the father or other parent, by the acknowledgement of a bond of filiation in the declaration of birth in accordance with the rules prescribed by this Code. In the absence of such an acknowledgement in the declaration of birth, uninterrupted possession of status is sufficient.
### Chunk 541

1991, c. 64, a. 523; 2023, c. 13, s. 10. 524. Uninterrupted possession of status is established by an adequate combination of facts which indicate the relationship of filiation between the child and the person who acts toward him as his parent. For possession to be uninterrupted, such conduct must begin at the child’s birth and continue for a minimum period of 24 months, except in exceptional circumstances. Uninterrupted possession of status may not be established in cases where it is exercised by more than one person simultaneously.
### Chunk 542

1991, c. 64, a. 524; 2023, c. 13, s. 11. 525. A child born during a marriage, civil union or de facto union or within 300 days after its dissolution or annulment or, in the case of a de facto union, its end, is presumed to have as the other parent the spouse of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him. The presumption is rebutted with regard to the former spouse where the child is born within 300 days of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage or civil union or of the end of the de facto union, but after a subsequent marriage, civil union or de facto union of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him.
### Chunk 543

The presumption is also rebutted if the child is born more than 300 days after the judgment ordering separation from bed and board of married spouses, unless the spouses have voluntarily resumed their community of life before the birth. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 133 of 556 ### Page 134 The presumption is rebutted as well if the child is born of an assisted procreation activity carried out after the death of the spouse of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him.

### Chunk 547

13, s. 14. 538. A parental project involving the use of the reproductive material of a third person is formed from the moment a person alone or spouses have decided, in order to have a child, to use the reproductive material of a person who is not party to the parental project and who agrees to their material being used for that purpose. The reproductive material may be provided through assisted procreation activities carried out in a centre for assisted procreation. The material may also be provided through artisanal insemination or sexual intercourse.
### Chunk 548

The parental project comprises all children born of it and it must not entail their being dissociated. 1991, c. 64, a. 538; 2002, c. 6, s. 30; 2023, c. 13, s. 15. 538. 1. The filiation of a child born of a parental project involving the use of the reproductive material of a third person is established with regard to the mother or the parent by the fact of their having given birth to the child. Filiation is established with regard to the other parent, if applicable, by the acknowledgement of a bond of filiation in the declaration of birth in accordance with the rules prescribed by this Code.
### Chunk 549

In the absence of such an acknowledgement in the declaration of birth, uninterrupted possession of status is sufficient. Uninterrupted possession of status is established by an adequate combination of facts which indicate the relationship of filiation between the child and the person who acts toward him as his parent. For the possession to be uninterrupted, such conduct must begin at the child’s birth and continue for a minimum period of 24 months, except in exceptional circumstances. Uninterrupted possession of status may not be established in cases where it is exercised by more than one person simultaneously.
### Chunk 550

2002, c. 6, s. 30; 2023, c. 13, s. 16. 538. 2. A child born of a parental project involving the use of the reproductive material of a third person may not claim filiation with regard to the third person who provided such reproductive material for the purposes of the project. Likewise, that third person may not claim a bond of filiation with regard to the child. 2002, c. 6, s. 30; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 13, s. 17. 538. 3. A child born of a parental project between spouses involving the use of the reproductive material of a third person and whose birth occurred during the spouses’ union or within 300 days after the dissolution or annulment of their marriage or civil union or the end of their de facto union is presumed to have as the other parent the spouse of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him.
### Chunk 551

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 135 of 556 ### Page 136 The presumption is rebutted with regard to the former spouse where the child is born within 300 days of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage or civil union or of the end of the de facto union, but after a subsequent marriage, civil union or de facto union of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him. The presumption is also rebutted if the child is born more than 300 days after the judgment ordering separation from bed and board of married spouses, unless the spouses have voluntarily resumed their community of life before the birth.
### Chunk 552

The presumption is rebutted as well if the child is born of an assisted procreation activity carried out after the death of the spouse of his mother or of the parent who gave birth to him. 2002, c. 6, s. 30; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 78; 2022, c. 22, s. 83. 539. Where a necessary condition for the validity of the parental project is not met, the filiation of the child is established in accordance with the rules of filiation by acknowledgement or by blood. However, no bond of filiation may be established with regard to the person who agreed to provide their reproductive material as a third person for the purposes of the project or with regard to the person who wanted to form the project but did not give birth to the child.

The parental project comprises all children born of it and must not entail their being dissociated.
### Chunk 555

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 2. The person alone or the spouses who have formed the parental project must, prior to the planned pregnancy, enter into a surrogacy agreement with the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child. No other person may be a party to the agreement. The woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child must be 21 years of age or over at the time the agreement is entered into. If the woman or the person is the sister, ascendant or descendant of the person alone or of one of the spouses who formed the parental project, there may be no combining, CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 136 of 556 ### Page 137 whatsoever, of the reproductive material of the woman or the person with that of a sibling, ascendant or descendant of the woman or the person.
### Chunk 556

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 3. The contribution made to the parental project by the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to a child must be gratuitous. However, the woman or person is entitled, in accordance with the standards determined by government regulation, to the reimbursement or payment of certain expenses and to compensation, where applicable, for loss of work income resulting from that contribution. If domiciled outside Québec, the woman or person is also entitled, as provided for by the law of the State of their domicile, to the reimbursement or payment of certain expenses and to compensation for loss of work income.
### Chunk 557

The person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project may not claim reimbursement of the amounts they paid under the first paragraph for the sole reason that the project was not carried to completion. 2023, c. 13, ss. 20 and 70. 541. 4. For the parental project involving surrogacy to be carried to completion, the woman or the person who gave birth to the child shall, after the birth, consent to the filiation of the child being established exclusively with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project.
### Chunk 558

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 5. Renunciation by the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child of their right to express, after the child’s birth, their will as to the establishment of the child’s filiation is without effect. A clause tending to prevent the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to a child from expressing consent in a free and enlightened manner, after the child’s birth, is without effect. A penal clause intended for the same purpose is also without effect.
### Chunk 559

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 6. The child may not claim filiation with regard to the woman or the person who gave birth to him in the context of a parental project involving surrogacy to which the woman or person contributed. Likewise, the woman or person may not claim a bond of filiation with regard to the child once their consent to the filiation of the child being established exclusively with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project has been given or is deemed to have been given.
### Chunk 560

2023, c. 13, s. 20. II. — Children born of a parental project in which the parties to the agreement are domiciled in Québec 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 1. — General provisions 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 7. The person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project and the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child must have been domiciled in Québec for at least one year prior to entering into the surrogacy agreement in order for the rules allowing the legal or judicial establishment of the child’s filiation to apply to the parental project involving surrogacy.
### Chunk 561

2023, c. 13, ss. 20 and 68. 541. 8. Only the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to a child in the context of a parental project involving surrogacy may, at any time before the child’s birth, unilaterally terminate the surrogacy agreement; the woman or the person must then do so in writing and notify a copy to the person alone or the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 137 of 556 ### Page 138 spouses who formed the parental project.
### Chunk 562

In the latter case, notification given to one of the spouses is deemed to have been given to the other spouse. Where there is a termination of the pregnancy, the surrogacy agreement is terminated without further formality. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 9. To give consent, the woman or the person who gave birth to the child must expressly consent to their bond of filiation with regard to the child being deemed never to have existed and to the establishment of a bond of filiation with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project.
### Chunk 563

Consent shall be given by notarial act en minute or by a private writing before two witnesses who have no interest in the surrogacy project. In the latter case, the author and the witnesses sign it, indicating the date and place the consent is given. Consent may also be given by a judicial declaration, in the course of proceedings relating to the filiation of the child. Refusal to consent is subject to no formal requirement. Consent given in a language other than French shall be accompanied by a translation authenticated in Québec.
### Chunk 564

A government regulation may determine other elements to be covered by the consent as well as the contents of the document in which it is stated. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 10. The amounts reimbursed for certain expenses and, if applicable, paid as compensation for loss of work income to the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child, in consideration of their contribution to a parental project involving surrogacy, are exempt from seizure. However, compensation paid for loss of work income is seizable with regard to a debt of support in accordance with articles 694 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 565

01), with the necessary modifications. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 2. — Prior conditions and legal establishment of filiation 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 11. Before the beginning of the pregnancy, the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child must meet, without the presence of the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, with a professional qualified to inform the woman or the person of the psychosocial implications of the surrogacy project and of the ethical issues it involves.
### Chunk 566

The same applies to the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project. At the end of the meeting, the professional gives a signed attestation to each person the professional met with confirming that they attended the meeting. The professional must be a member of a professional order designated by the Minister of Justice. The latter determines, by regulation, any standard relating to the conduct of the information meeting. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. See M. O. 20235103, 20231019, (2023) 155 G.
### Chunk 567

O. 2, 2702. 541. 12. Following the information meeting, the parties to the surrogacy project who wish to pursue it must, by notarial act en minute, enter into a surrogacy agreement. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 138 of 556 ### Page 139 The agreement is drawn up in French. The parties may be bound only by a version in a language other than French if, after examining the French version, such is their express wish. The notary shall obtain from each of the parties the attestation received at the information meeting, and shall mention having done so in the agreement.
### Chunk 568

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 13. The surrogacy agreement establishes the nature of the expenses that may be paid or reimbursed to the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child and provides whether the woman or person is entitled to compensation for loss of work income, in accordance with the regulation referred to in article 541. 3. The agreement also provides for the deposit, in a trust account of the notary who executes it, of an amount to allow the performance of the obligations of the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project.
### Chunk 569

The agreement also contains the information determined by government regulation concerning the profile of the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child and of any other party to the agreement who intends to provide their reproductive material. A government regulation may provide for any other standard relating to the content of the agreement or to the deposit referred to in the first paragraph, including cases in which such a deposit need not be made. 2023, c. 13, s. 20.
### Chunk 570

541. 14. After his birth, the child is entrusted to the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, unless the woman or the person who gave birth to the child objects to it. In the event that the person alone or the spouses are deceased or unable to act, the child is entrusted to the director of youth protection. Entrusting the child entails, by operation of law, the delegation of the exercise of parental authority and of tutorship to the person alone, the spouses or the director of youth protection, as the case may be.
### Chunk 571

Where the delegation is evidenced in writing, it shall be evidenced by notarial act en minute or by a private writing drawn up before two witnesses who have no interest in the surrogacy project. In the latter case, the author and the witnesses sign it, indicating the date and place of execution. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 15. The consent of the woman or the person who gave birth to the child must be given within 30 days from the birth of the child, but not before seven days have elapsed since the birth.
### Chunk 572

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 16. If the conditions for the legal establishment of filiation are met, the child’s filiation is deemed established exclusively with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project from the child’s birth. The child’s birth is declared to the registrar of civil status in accordance with the rules prescribed by this Code. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 17. If the woman or the person who gave birth to the child disappears with the child before expressing their will concerning the establishment of the child’s filiation or refuses to have their bond of filiation with regard to the child be deemed never to have existed and to have a bond of filiation be established with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project, as the case may be, the filiation of the child is established in accordance with the rules of filiation by acknowledgement or by blood.
### Chunk 573

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 139 of 556 ### Page 140 However, the presumption with regard to the spouse of the woman or person who gave birth to the child does not apply. Furthermore, no bond of filiation may be established with regard to the person who has agreed to provide their reproductive material as a third person for the purposes of the project. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 18. Where the woman or the person who gave birth to the child dies before expressing their will concerning the establishment of the child’s filiation, their consent is deemed to have been given.
### Chunk 574

Filiation is then deemed established exclusively with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project from the child’s birth. The same applies in cases where the woman or the person became incapable of giving consent before expressing their will, provided the incapacity is certified by a member of a professional order designated by the Minister of Justice. Such certification may be communicated to the person alone or to the spouses who formed the parental project, despite the professional being bound by professional secrecy with regard to the person to whom the certificate pertains.
### Chunk 575

This presumption applies only if 30 days have elapsed since the child’s birth. The child’s birth is declared to the registrar of civil status in accordance with the rules prescribed by this Code. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 19. Should the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, or one of them, die, be unable to act or disappear, the child’s filiation is deemed established exclusively with regard to that person alone or those spouses, subject to the consent of the woman or the person who gave birth to the child.
### Chunk 576

The child’s birth is declared to the registrar of civil status in accordance with the rules prescribed by this Code. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 3. — Judicial establishment of filiation 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 20. Where a prior condition for the legal establishment of the child’s filiation is not met, the filiation of the child is established in accordance with the rules of filiation by acknowledgement or by blood. However, the presumption with regard to the spouse of the woman or person who gave birth to the child does not apply.
### Chunk 577

Furthermore, no bond of filiation may be established with regard to the person who has agreed to provide their reproductive material as a third person for the purposes of the parental project. Only the court is then authorized to change the filiation. An application to that effect must be submitted to the court within 60 days after the birth of the child, except in exceptional circumstances. 2023, c. 13, ss. 20 and 68. 541. 21. Where the court is seized of an application to change the child’s filiation, it ascertains that the general conditions relating to the parental project involving surrogacy have been met.
### Chunk 578

It therefore ascertains, in particular, that the woman or the person who gave birth to the child has consented to their bond of filiation with regard to the child being deemed never to have existed and to such a bond being established with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project, as the case may be. If the court finds the parental project to be compliant, it confirms the existence of a parental project involving surrogacy and changes the child’s filiation to establish it with regard to that person or to the spouses.
### Chunk 579

Filiation is then deemed established exclusively with regard to them from the child’s birth. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 140 of 556 ### Page 141 If the court finds otherwise, it declares the parental project involving surrogacy null and dismisses the application. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 22. Where the child’s filiation is changed with regard to the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, the change is made despite their death, their inability to act or their disappearance.
### Chunk 580

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 23. In the event that the woman or the person who gave birth to the child dies before expressing their will concerning the establishment of the child’s filiation, their consent is deemed to have been given. The same rule applies in the event that the woman or the person who gave birth to the child becomes incapable of giving consent before expressing their will. This presumption applies only if 30 days have elapsed since the child’s birth. 2023, c. 13, s.
### Chunk 581

20. 541. 24. In the event that the woman or the person who gave birth to the child disappears without the child before expressing their will concerning the establishment of the child’s filiation, their consent is presumed to have been given if 30 days have elapsed since the child’s birth. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 25. Where the court is seized of an application related to the filiation of a child born of a parental project involving surrogacy, it rules, if need be, on the fees payable to the advocate or, as the case may be, to the notary representing the woman or the person who gave birth to the child, which are borne by the person alone or by the spouses who formed the parental project, who are solidarily liable for them.
### Chunk 582

2023, c. 13, s. 20. III. — Children born of a parental project in which the woman or the person who gave birth to the child is domiciled outside Québec 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 1. — Prior conditions 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 26. Every parental project involving surrogacy in which the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to a child is domiciled outside Québec must comply with the general conditions applicable to any parental project involving surrogacy and those prescribed by this subdivision, regardless of the nationality of the person alone or the spouses who formed the project, of whether they have a residence in the State of the domicile of the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child or otherwise have a right to act in a foreign State under the applicable law in that State and regardless of whether the filiation of the child born of such project has been established in a foreign State.
### Chunk 583

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 27. The parental project shall, before the process is set in motion, be submitted for prior authorization to the Minister of Health and Social Services by the person alone or the spouses who formed the project. The authorization is given on condition, in particular, that the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project provide the attestation received after the information meeting, that the State chosen by the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 141 of 556 ### Page 142 person or the spouses is designated by the Government and that the project meets the other conditions prescribed by law.
### Chunk 584

The Government may, by regulation, prescribe additional conditions the parental project must meet for the authorization to be obtained. The Minister notifies the registrar of civil status of every parental project the Minister receives for authorization, whether the project is authorized or not. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 28. The person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project must have been domiciled in Québec for at least one year before applying for prior authorization.
### Chunk 585

Where the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child is domiciled outside Canada, the person alone or at least one of the spouses must, in addition, be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident. If the parental project does not involve a Canadian citizen, the reproductive material provided for the conception of the child who is the subject of the parental project must be the permanent resident’s reproductive material. The Government may, by regulation, determine other conditions that must be met by the person alone or the spouses who formed such a parental project.
### Chunk 586

2023, c. 13, ss. 20 and 69. 541. 29. The person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project must meet with a professional qualified to inform them of the psychosocial implications of such a project and of the ethical issues it involves. At the end of the meeting, the professional gives a signed attestation to each person the professional met with confirming that they attended the meeting. The professional must be a member of a professional order designated by the Minister of Justice.
### Chunk 587

The latter determines, by regulation, any standard relating to the conduct of the information meeting. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. See M. O. 20235103, 20231019, (2023) 155 G. O. 2, 2702. 541. 30. The consent of the woman or the person who gave birth to the child must be given in express terms, in writing or by a judicial declaration in the course of proceedings relating to the filiation of the child. Consent given in a language other than French shall be accompanied by a translation authenticated in Québec.
### Chunk 588

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 31. The parental project may be carried out only if the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child is domiciled in a foreign State designated by the Government. The Government may only designate a foreign State where the rules and practices relating to surrogacy are not contrary to public order and respect the interest of the child once born, including the child’s safety and integrity, as well as the safety and integrity of the other persons involved in a surrogacy project.
### Chunk 589

The Government may also take into account any other criteria it considers appropriate. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 142 of 556 ### Page 143 Such a designation is made on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health and Social Services as well as, as the case may be, the Minister of International Relations or the Minister responsible for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. See Order in Council 8432024 dated 15 May 2024, (2024) 156 G.
### Chunk 590

O. 2, 1837. 541. 32. Once the prior authorization has been obtained, the surrogacy agreement, accompanied by the information concerning the profile of the woman or the person who has agreed to give birth to the child and the documents determined by government regulation, must, before being signed, be submitted to the Minister of Health and Social Services for authorization, according to the terms prescribed by such a regulation. If the Minister considers that the agreement is compliant, the Minister issues an authorization to proceed with the parental project involving surrogacy.
### Chunk 591

A copy of the signed agreement is filed with the Minister, together with the necessary documents, by the person alone or the spouses who formed the project. Any modification to the agreement must be authorized by the Minister. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 33. The Minister of Health and Social Services must be notified, by the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, of every birth resulting from a project that the Minister has authorized. The Minister then ascertains that the project is compliant as a whole and may require any information or any document he considers necessary from that person or those spouses.
### Chunk 592

In analyzing the project, the Minister shall, among other things, ascertain that the child was born in a designated State. If the Minister considers that the implementation of the project is compliant with the project the Minister has authorized, the Minister issues a certificate of compliance to the person alone or the spouses who formed the project. If the Minister finds otherwise, the Minister informs the person or the spouses of the refusal to issue such a certificate and of the reasons for the refusal.
### Chunk 593

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 2. — Judicial recognition of filiation 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 34. An act of birth drawn up by a foreign competent authority proving the child’s filiation with regard to the person alone or the spouses who formed a parental project or one of them must be recognized by the court in Québec. The same applies to a decision rendered abroad that establishes such a filiation. In the case of a filiation that is proved or established with regard to only one spouse, an application to claim status concerning the other spouse must be attached to the application for recognition.
### Chunk 594

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 35. The steps necessary for the recognition of an act of birth drawn up by a foreign authority or of a decision establishing filiation rendered abroad shall be undertaken by the person alone or the spouses who formed a parental project as soon as possible after they receive the certificate of compliance from the Minister of Health and Social Services or a notice of the Minister’s refusal to issue the certificate. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 143 of 556 ### Page 144 If the steps for recognition are not undertaken or completed within a reasonable time, the director of youth protection may, at the request of the Minister of Health and Social Services, take, in the place and stead of the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project, all necessary measures to undertake or complete those steps or put an end to them.
### Chunk 595

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 36. The court, where called upon to recognize an act of birth drawn up by a foreign competent authority proving filiation with regard to the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project involving surrogacy or one of them or to recognize a decision establishing such a filiation rendered abroad, ascertains that all the rules applicable to such a project have been complied with, both according to the law of Québec and the law of the State from which the act of birth or decision originates.
### Chunk 596

It thus ascertains, in particular, that the woman or the person who gave birth to the child gave their consent, after the birth of the child, to the child’s filiation being established exclusively with regard to the person alone or both spouses who formed the parental project. Where the woman or the person who gave birth to the child died before expressing their will concerning the establishment of the child’s filiation, their consent is deemed to have been given. The same applies where the woman or person became incapable of giving consent before expressing their will after the child’s birth.
### Chunk 597

The court also ascertains that the Minister of Health and Social Services has issued a certificate of compliance. In the absence of such a certificate, the court hears the parties, including the Minister, and, if it finds that the surrogacy project does not comply with the general conditions applicable to any parental project involving surrogacy, it refuses to recognize the act or decision. Recognition may, for serious reasons and if the interest of the child demands it, be granted even if no steps have been undertaken with the Minister by the person alone or by the spouses who formed a parental project or if steps are only partly completed.
### Chunk 598

2023, c. 13, s. 20. 541. 37. The recognition of an act of birth drawn up by a foreign competent authority or of a decision rendered abroad produces, from the date on which the child’s filiation took effect in the foreign State with regard to the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project or one of them, the same effects as if that act had been drawn up in Québec or as if the decision had been rendered there. 2023, c. 13, s. 20. 3. — Confidentiality of personal information and documents relating to the procreation of a child involving the contribution of a third person and rules for communicating such information and documents 2023, c.

13, s. 21. I. — Confidentiality of personal information and documents relating to the procreation of a child involving the contribution of a third person 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. Personal information and documents relating to the procreation of a child involving the contribution of a third person and held by a centre for assisted procreation, a professional or a public body, as the case may be, are confidential, except as otherwise provided by law. However, if the health of the person born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person, of that third person or of a close relative genetically linked to them warrants it, the court may allow the necessary medical information to be sent, confidentially, to the medical authorities concerned.

The person also has the right to obtain, according to the terms determined by government regulation, a copy of the surrogacy agreement, of the judgment concerning the person’s filiation, if applicable, as well as of the other documents contained in the judicial file and of any other documents determined by the regulation.
### Chunk 602

The communication of any document must, however, be made in keeping with any contact veto registered, and the passages that provide information making contact with the third person possible must be deleted or redacted accordingly. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. The first paragraph of this article comes into force on 6 March 2024 to the extent that it concerns the power of the Government to determine in a regulation the information concerning the profile of the third person who contributed to the procreation of a child born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person.
### Chunk 603

(O. C. 1052024, (2024) 156 G. O. 2, 371). Not in force 542. 2. It is the responsibility of the child’s parent to inform the child of the fact that he was born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person. It is also the parent’s responsibility to inform the child of the rules concerning the disclosure of the third person’s name, the information concerning the third person’s profile, the information making contact with the third person possible and the documents to which the child is entitled.

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 5. A third person who has contributed to the procreation of a child shall, at the time of the first request for information about them, be informed of the request by the authority designated by law so as to have the opportunity to express their will regarding contact, indicating, if applicable, the conditions under which contact is authorized. If the third person is untraceable or incapable of expressing their will, disclosure of the third person’s name entails, by operation of law, a contact veto.
### Chunk 607

In the event the third person is found or again becomes capable of expressing their will, the third person must be given the opportunity to maintain or withdraw the veto. A third person who has registered a contact veto following a first request may, at any time, withdraw the veto by so notifying the authority designated by law. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 6. In the event the person sought is deceased, only the person’s name, the information concerning the person’s profile and, if applicable, the documents referred to in the second paragraph of article 542.

The person who obtains the information on that condition but violates the condition is liable towards the person sought and may also be required to pay punitive damages. 2023, c. 13, s. 21.
### Chunk 609

Not in force 542. 8. Where the request concerns the woman or the person who gave birth to the child in the context of a parental project involving surrogacy while domiciled outside Québec, communication of the information making contact with the woman or person possible is subject to the woman’s or person’s consent, unless the law of the State of the woman’s or person’s domicile provides otherwise. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 9. Psychosocial support services are offered to any person who undertakes steps to receive communication of information and documents to which the person is entitled, and also to any other person who is the subject of such steps, where they express the need for such services to the authority designated by law.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 146 of 556 ### Page 147 The authority refers those persons to the person or institution designated by the Minister of Health and Social Services for the provision of such services. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 10. The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity keeps a register containing the information and documents to which a person born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person is entitled as well as those relating to the third person’s will regarding contact with that person.
### Chunk 611

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 11. The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity is the designated authority for disclosing to any person born of a parental project involving the use of reproductive material from a third person or involving surrogacy in which all the parties are domiciled in Québec, or to his descendants in the first degree, if applicable, who apply to the Minister, the information and documents held by the Minister and that they are entitled to obtain under this subdivision.
### Chunk 612

The Minister is also the designated authority for disclosing, to a physician who provides to the Minister a certificate confirming that the health of the person born of such a project, of the third person who contributed to it or of a close relative genetically linked to them, as the case may be, warrants the communication of medical information, information held by the Minister under this subdivision which the physician is entitled to obtain under article 542. 18. If the Minister has grounds to believe that information or documents are lacking or incomplete, the Minister may make a summary investigation to obtain the required information.
### Chunk 613

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 12. The Minister of Health and Social Services is the designated authority for disclosing to any person born of a parental project involving surrogacy in which the woman or the person who gave birth to the child is domiciled outside Québec, or to his descendants in the first degree, if applicable, who apply to the Minister, the information and documents contained in the register kept by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and that they are entitled to obtain under this subdivision.
### Chunk 614

The Minister of Health and Social Services is also the designated authority for disclosing, to a physician who provides to the Minister a certificate confirming that the health of the person born of such a project, of the third person who contributed to it or of a close relative genetically linked to them, as the case may be, warrants the communication of medical information, information contained in that register which the physician is entitled to obtain under article 542. 18. In addition, the Minister is responsible for entering in the register the information and wishes collected in the exercise of the Minister’s functions as the designated authority and for depositing the documents received in the register.
### Chunk 615

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 13. The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and the Minister of Health and Social Services may require from public bodies holding information or documents necessary for locating the third person who contributed to the procreation the communication of such information or documents.

### Chunk 616

13, s. 21. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 147 of 556 ### Page 148 Not in force 542. 14. In the case of a surrogacy project in which all the parties are domiciled in Québec and at the end of which the child’s filiation was established by law, the registrar of civil status deposits in the register the authentic copy of the surrogacy agreement, in the form of a notarial act en minute, which accompanies the declaration of birth. After drawing up the child’s act of birth, the registrar enters the child’s name and date of birth and any other information determined by government regulation in the register.
### Chunk 617

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 15. In the case of a parental project involving the use of a third person’s reproductive material through artisanal insemination or sexual intercourse, the name of the third person, the information making it possible to contact them and the information concerning their profile, determined by government regulation, are collected by the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project. The same applies in the case of a parental project involving the use of reproductive material from outside Québec in the context of assisted procreation activities carried out in a centre for assisted procreation, to the extent that the information is known.
### Chunk 618

In the case of a parental project involving the use of reproductive material from Québec in the context of assisted procreation activities carried out in a centre for assisted procreation, the third person’s identifier assigned by the centre is collected by the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project. The information is transmitted, at the time the child’s declaration of birth is made, to the registrar of civil status by the person alone or the spouses who formed the parental project.
### Chunk 619

After drawing up the act of birth, the registrar of civil status enters that information, the child’s name and date of birth, and the other information determined by government regulation, in the register. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 16. Once the judgment recognizing an act of birth drawn up outside Québec or a foreign decision has become final, the Minister of Health and Social Services files that judgment and the surrogacy agreement in the register and enters therein the name of the woman or the person who gave birth to the child and the information making it possible to contact the woman or the person.
### Chunk 620

The Minister also enters in the register the information concerning the profile of that woman or that person, determined by government regulation, that accompanied the agreement that was submitted to the Minister for authorization by the person alone or by the spouses who formed a parental project involving surrogacy in which the woman or the person who gave birth to the child is domiciled outside Québec. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 17. For the purposes of this division, where no bond of filiation is established between a child born of procreation involving surrogacy and a party to the parental project who has provided their reproductive material, that party is considered to be a third person having contributed to the procreation of the child; the woman or the person who gave birth to the child is then considered to be a person alone having formed a parental project involving the use of the reproductive material of that third person.
### Chunk 621

In such a case, the woman or person sends to the registrar of civil status, at the time the child’s declaration of birth is made, the name of the third person, the information making it possible to contact the latter and the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 148 of 556 ### Page 149 information concerning the latter’s profile, determined by government regulation. After drawing up the act of birth, the registrar of civil status enters that information, the child’s name and date of birth, and the other information determined by government regulation in the register.
### Chunk 622

2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force III. — Disclosure of medical information 2023, c. 13, s. 21. Not in force 542. 18. Where a physician is of the opinion that the health of a person born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person, of that third person or of a close relative genetically linked to them warrants it, the physician may obtain the necessary medical information from the medical authorities concerned, subject to the consent of the person whose information is requested.
### Chunk 623

In the absence of such consent, the court’s authorization is required to obtain such information. The authority designated by law shall, after obtaining the consent of the person whose medical information is requested, disclose the information making it possible to identify that person and to contact that person or the person’s physician to a physician who provides the authority with a written attestation confirming that the health of the person born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person, of that third person or of a close relative genetically linked to them, as the case may be, warrants the disclosure of medical information.
### Chunk 624

Where the information requested concerns a woman or a person who gave birth to a child in the context of a parental project involving surrogacy who is domiciled outside Québec, that obligation applies, provided such disclosure of information is not prohibited by the State of their domicile. The anonymity of the persons concerned must be preserved. A physician who receives information referred to in the second paragraph must take appropriate security measures to ensure its confidentiality. 2023, c.
### Chunk 625

13, s. 21. DIVISION IV ACTIONS RELATING TO FILIATION 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 19. No one may claim filiation contrary to that assigned by their act of birth and the uninterrupted possession of status consistent with that act. Unless otherwise provided by law, no one may contest the status of a person whose uninterrupted possession of status is consistent with their act of birth. Where uninterrupted possession of status cannot be established because it is exercised by more than one person simultaneously, the person who is biologically related to the child takes precedence.
### Chunk 626

However, in the case of a child born of procreation involving the contribution of a third person, the person who formed a parental project with the child’s parent takes precedence. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 20. No one may contest the filiation of a child on the sole ground that he was born of a parental project involving the contribution of a third person. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 149 of 556 ### Page 150 However, the filiation of a child whose uninterrupted possession of status is not consistent with his act of birth may be contested by providing proof that the person with whom the filiation is established was not a party to the parental project or, as the case may be, that the child was not born of that project.
### Chunk 627

2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 21. Any interested person, including the father or mother or one of the child’s parents, may, by any means, contest the filiation of a person whose uninterrupted possession of status is not consistent with his act of birth. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 22. A child may contest his filiation on the sole ground that he was born as a result of sexual assault committed by his father or by the parent who did not give birth to him, whether or not there is uninterrupted possession of status consistent with his act of birth.
### Chunk 628

The contestation can only be granted if the interest of the child demands it. The child may apply for the definitive restoration of the bond of filiation that was withdrawn at his request, unless he has been adopted. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 23. A child whose filiation appearing in his act of birth is not consistent with the filiation established by uninterrupted possession of status may claim his filiation before the court. Similarly, the father and mother or the parents may claim a bond of filiation with regard to a child whose uninterrupted possession of status is not consistent with his act of birth.
### Chunk 629

If the child already has another filiation established by the acknowledgement of a bond of filiation in the declaration of birth, by uninterrupted possession of status, or by the effect of the presumption with regard to the spouse of the woman or person who gave birth to him, an action to claim status may not be brought unless it is joined to an action contesting the status thus established. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 24. A child born as a result of sexual assault may object to a bond of filiation being established between him and the person who committed the assault.
### Chunk 630

The child’s objection shall not prevent the child from claiming such a bond of filiation. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 25. Actions are directed against the child and, if applicable, against the person who is the subject of the claim or contestation. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 26. Proof of filiation may be made by any mode of proof. However, testimony is not admissible unless there is a commencement of proof, or unless the presumptions or indications resulting from already clearly established facts are sufficiently strong to permit its admission.
### Chunk 631

2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 27. Commencement of proof results from the family documents, domestic records and papers, and all other public or private writings originating from a party engaged in the contestation or who would have an interest therein if the party were alive. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 150 of 556 ### Page 151 542. 28. Every mode of proof is admissible to contest an action concerning filiation. 2023, c.
### Chunk 632

13, s. 21. 542. 29. For the purposes of articles 542. 22 and 542. 24, sexual assault may be proved, among other means, by the production of a judgment recognizing its existence. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 30. Where the court is seized of an action concerning filiation, it may, on the application of an interested person, order the analysis of a sample of a bodily substance so that the genetic profile of a person involved in the action may be established. However, where the purpose of the action is to establish filiation, the court may not issue such an order unless a commencement of proof of filiation has been established by the person having brought the action or unless the presumptions or indications resulting from facts already clearly established by that person are sufficiently strong to warrant such an order.
### Chunk 633

The court determines conditions for the sampletaking and analysis that are as respectful as possible of the physical integrity of the person concerned or of the body of the deceased. These conditions include the nature and the date and place of the sampletaking, the identity of the expert charged with taking and analyzing the sample, the use of any sample taken and the confidentiality of the analysis results. The court may draw a negative presumption from an unjustified refusal to submit to the analysis ordered by the court.
### Chunk 634

2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 31. The court may establish the filiation of a child born of an assisted procreation activity with regard to a person who was deceased at the time the activity was carried out if it is shown to the court that (1) the person was a party to the parental project at the time of the death; and (2) the child was conceived using the reproductive material of the person or, as the case may be, the reproductive material that the person had decided to use to have a child.
### Chunk 635

Participation of that person in the parental project is presumed if that person and the parent with regard to whom filiation with the child is established were spouses at the time of the death and if the child is born of the transfer of an embryo created before the death. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 32. Actions concerning filiation are not subject to prescription. In the event that the child or the child’s father or mother or parent is deceased, the heirs must act within three years of the death, under pain of forfeiture.

2023, c. 13, s. 21. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 151 of 556 ### Page 152 DIVISION V FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION AS SUPPORT FOR THE NEEDS OF A CHILD BORN AS A RESULT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 33. A person who commits a sexual assault must, in the absence of a bond of filiation with the child born as a result of the assault, pay to the victim of the assault a financial contribution as support, in the form of a lump sum, to meet the child’s needs from his birth until he attains sufficient autonomy.
### Chunk 637

The sexual assault may be proved, among other means, by the production of a judgment recognizing its existence. The Minister of Justice may, by regulation, determine standards according to which the contribution is set, including the minimum amount of the contribution. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 34. If there is a significant change in the child’s state of health due to circumstances unknown or unforeseeable at the time the initial contribution was determined and the change is such as to substantially alter the child’s needs or significantly delay or prevent the child from attaining autonomy, the person who committed the sexual assault must pay a contribution to meet the child’s additional needs until he attains autonomy, given the circumstances.
### Chunk 638

2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 35. If the victim of the sexual assault does not exercise the rights conferred by this division, the child of full age may apply to have the part of the contribution intended to meet his needs from the time he reaches the age of majority paid directly to him. The application must be notified to the victim. The contribution may not extend to a need whose existence dates back more than three years before the application. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 36.
### Chunk 639

For the purposes of article 542. 33, where the sexual assault is proved, the court may order the analysis of a sample of a bodily substance, so that the genetic profile of the person who committed the sexual assault may be established. The court determines conditions for the sampletaking and analysis that are as respectful as possible of the physical integrity of the person concerned or of the body of the deceased. These conditions include the nature and the date and place of the sampletaking, the identity of the expert charged with taking and analyzing the sample, the use of any sample taken and the confidentiality of the analysis results.
### Chunk 640

The court may draw a negative presumption from an unjustified refusal to submit to the analysis ordered by the court. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. 542. 37. Where an action to claim a contribution to meet the needs of a child born as a result of a sexual assault is brought by the victim of the assault, it is not subject to prescription. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 152 of 556 ### Page 153 In the event that the person who committed the sexual assault is deceased, the action must be brought within six months after the death.
### Chunk 641

The same applies where the action is brought by a child of full age. 2023, c. 13, s. 21. CHAPTER III FILIATION BY ADOPTION 1991, c. 64, c. II; 2017, c. 12, s. 12; 2023, c. 13, s. 22. DIVISION I CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION § 1. — General provisions 543. No adoption may take place except in the interest of the child and on the conditions prescribed by law. No adoption may take place for the purpose of confirming a filiation already established by birth. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 642

543; 2023, c. 13, s. 23. 543. 1. Conditions of adoption under any Québec Aboriginal custom that is in harmony with the principles of the interest of the child, respect for the child’s rights and the consent of the persons concerned may be substituted for conditions prescribed by law. In such cases, unless otherwise provided, the provisions of this chapter that follow, except Division III, do not apply to an adoption made in accordance with such a custom. Such an adoption which, according to custom, creates a bond of filiation between the child and the adopter is, on the application of either of them, attested by the authority that is competent for the Aboriginal community or nation of either the child or the adopter.
### Chunk 643

However, if the child and the adopter are members of different nations, the adoption is attested by the authority that is competent for the child’s nation or community. The competent authority issues a certificate attesting the adoption after making sure that it was carried out according to custom, in particular that the required consents were validly given and that the child is in the care of the adopter; the authority also makes sure that the adoption is in the interest of the child. 2017, c.
### Chunk 644

12, s. 13. 544. No minor child may be adopted unless his father and mother, his parents or his tutor have consented to the adoption or unless he has been judicially declared eligible for adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 544; 2022, c. 22, s. 86. 544. 1. Consents to adoption are given for an adoption with recognition of the preexisting bond or bonds of filiation, an adoption without such recognition or, indiscriminately, for either. 2017, c. 12, s. 14. 545. No person of full age may be adopted except by the persons who fulfilled the role of a parent towards him when he was a minor.
### Chunk 645

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 153 of 556 ### Page 154 The court, however, may dispense with this requirement in the interest of the person to be adopted, taking into consideration, among other things, the quality, duration and continuity of relations between the adopter and the person of full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 545; 2016, c. 4, s. 80; 2017, c. 12, s. 15. 546. Any person of full age may, alone or jointly with another person, adopt a child.
### Chunk 646

1991, c. 64, a. 546. 547. A person may not be an adopter unless he is at least 18 years older than the person adopted, except where the person adopted is the child of the spouse of the adopter. The court may, however, dispense with this requirement in the interest of the person to be adopted. 1991, c. 64, a. 547. 547. 1. Every person wishing to adopt a minor child shall undergo a psychosocial assessment made in accordance with the conditions provided in the Youth Protection Act (chapter P34.
### Chunk 647

1), unless the adoption is based on a special consent, in which case the assessment is at the discretion of the court. 2017, c. 12, s. 16. 548. Consent provided for in this chapter shall be given in writing and before two witnesses. The same rule applies to the withdrawal of consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 548. § 2. — Consent of the adopted person 549. No child 10 years of age or over may be adopted without his consent, unless he is unable to express his will. However, when a child under 14 years of age refuses to give his consent, the court may defer its judgment for the period of time it indicates, or grant adoption notwithstanding his refusal.
### Chunk 648

1991, c. 64, a. 549. 550. Refusal by a child 14 years of age or over is a bar to adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 550. § 3. — Consent of parents or tutor 551. When adoption takes place with the consent of the parents, the consent of both parents to the adoption is necessary if the filiation of the child is established with regard to both of them. If the filiation of the child is established with regard to only one parent, the consent of that parent is sufficient. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 649

551. 552. If either parent is deceased, is unable to express his or her will or is deprived of parental authority, the consent of the other parent is sufficient and must be given separately for each of the child’s bonds of filiation. 1991, c. 64, a. 552; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 17. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 154 of 556 ### Page 155 553. If both parents are deceased, if they are unable to express their will, or if they are deprived of parental authority, the adoption of the child is subject to the consent of the tutor, if the child has a tutor.
### Chunk 650

The tutor’s consent must be given separately for each of the child’s bonds of filiation. 1991, c. 64, a. 553; 2017, c. 12, s. 18. 554. A parent of minor age may himself, without authorization, give his consent to the adoption of his child. 1991, c. 64, a. 554. 555. Consent to adoption may be general or special; special consent may be given only in favour of an ascendant of the child, a relative in the collateral line to the third degree or the spouse of that ascendant or relative; it may also be given in favour of the spouse of the father or mother or of either parent.
### Chunk 651

However, in the case of de facto spouses, they must have been cohabiting for at least three years. 1991, c. 64, a. 555; 2002, c. 6, s. 31; 2022, c. 22, s. 87. 556. Until the order of placement, consent to adoption entails, by operation of law, delegation of parental authority to the person to whom the child is entrusted. 1991, c. 64, a. 556; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 81. 557. A person who has given his consent to adoption may withdraw it within 30 days from the date it was given.
### Chunk 652

The child shall then be returned without formality or delay to the person who has withdrawn his consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 557. 558. If a person has not withdrawn his consent within 30 days, he may, at any time before the order of placement, apply to the court to have the child returned. 1991, c. 64, a. 558. § 4. — Declaration of eligibility for adoption 559. The following may be judicially declared eligible for adoption: (1) a child over three months old, if neither his paternal filiation nor his maternal filiation nor his filiation with regard to either of his parents has been established; (2) a child whose care, maintenance or education has not in fact been assumed by his father and mother or parents or tutor for at least six months; (3) a child whose father and mother or parents have been deprived of parental authority, if he has no tutor; (4) a child who has neither father nor mother nor parents, if he has no tutor.
### Chunk 653

1991, c. 64, a. 559; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 88. 560. An application for a declaration of eligibility for adoption may be made by no one except an ascendant of the child, a relative in the collateral line to the third degree, the spouse of such an ascendant or relative, the child himself if 14 years of age or over, or a director of youth protection. 1991, c. 64, a. 560. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 155 of 556 ### Page 156 561.
### Chunk 654

A child may not be declared eligible for adoption unless it is unlikely that his father, his mother, one of his parents or his tutor will resume custody of him and assume his care, maintenance or education. This unlikelihood is presumed. 1991, c. 64, a. 561; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 89. 562.

2017, c. 12, s. 19. 562. 2. A person domiciled in Québec may not adopt a child who is in Québec unless that child is authorized to remain permanently in Canada. 2017, c. 12, s. 19. 563. Every person domiciled in Québec wishing to adopt a minor child domiciled outside Québec shall, even if the person is related to the child, first undergo a psychosocial assessment made in accordance with the conditions provided in the Youth Protection Act (chapter P34. 1). 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 657

563; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 20. 564. Arrangements for the adoption of a minor child must be made by a body certified by the Minister of Health and Social Services pursuant to the Youth Protection Act (chapter P34. 1), unless that minister prescribes otherwise by regulation. 1991, c. 64, a. 564; 2004, c. 3, s. 14; 2017, c. 12, s. 21. 565. The adoption of a child domiciled outside Québec must be granted abroad or granted by judicial decision in Québec. A judgment granted in Québec is preceded by an order of placement.
### Chunk 658

A decision granted abroad must be recognized by the court in Québec, unless the adoption has been certified by the competent authority of the State where it took place as having been made in accordance with the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 565; 2004, c. 3, s. 14. 565. 1. The adoption of a child domiciled outside Québec granted or recognized in Québec results in the dissolution of the preexisting bond of filiation between the child and his family of origin.
### Chunk 659

The court must make sure, where applicable, that the consents have been given to that effect. 2017, c. 12, s. 22. 565. 2. An Aboriginal customary adoption of a child domiciled outside Québec, but in Canada, which creates a bond of filiation between the child and an adopter domiciled in Québec may be recognized in Québec if the adoption is confirmed by an act issued under the applicable law in the State of the child’s CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 156 of 556 ### Page 157 domicile.
### Chunk 660

The adoption may be recognized either by the court or by the authority that is competent to issue a customary adoption certificate for the adopter’s community or nation. 2017, c. 12, s. 22. DIVISION II ORDER OF PLACEMENT AND ADOPTION JUDGMENT 566. The placement of a minor may not take place except by order of the court nor may the adoption of a child be granted unless the child has lived with the adopter for at least six months since the court order. The period may be reduced by up to three months, however, particularly in consideration of the time during which the minor has already lived with the adopter before the order.
### Chunk 661

1991, c. 64, a. 566; I. N. 20140501. 567. An order of placement may not be granted before the lapse of 30 days after the giving of consent to adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 567. 568. Before granting an order of placement, the court ascertains that the conditions for adoption have been complied with. Where the placement of a child domiciled outside Québec is made under an agreement entered into by virtue of the Youth Protection Act (chapter P34. 1), the court also verifies that the procedure followed is as provided in the agreement.
### Chunk 662

Where the placement of a child is made within the framework of the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, the court verifies that the conditions provided therein have been complied with. Even if the adopter has not complied with the provisions of articles 563 and 564, the placement may be ordered for serious reasons and if the interest of the child demands it. However, the application shall be accompanied with a psychosocial assessment made by the director of youth protection.
### Chunk 663

1991, c. 64, a. 568; 2004, c. 3, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 23. 568. 1. The court grants an order of placement for the purposes of an adoption in accordance with the application filed and with the consents given, if any were required. The court may not grant an order of placement for the purposes of an adoption with recognition of a pre existing bond of filiation unless it is in the interest of the child to recognize the bond in order to protect a meaningful identification of the child with the parent of origin.
### Chunk 664

2017, c. 12, s. 24. 569. The order of placement confers the exercise of parental authority on the adopter; it allows the child, for the term of the placement, to exercise his civil rights under the surname and given names that the court may assign to the child under article 576, which, if assigned, are recorded in the order. The order is a bar to the return of the child to his parents or to his tutor and to the establishment of the child’s filiation under the rules of filiation by birth.
### Chunk 665

1991, c. 64, a. 569; 2017, c. 12, s. 25; 2023, c. 13, s. 24. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 157 of 556 ### Page 158 570. The effects of the order of placement cease if placement terminates or if the court refuses to grant the adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 570. 571. If the adopter fails to present his application for adoption within a reasonable time after the expiry of the minimum period of placement, the order of placement may be revoked on the application of the child himself if he is 14 years of age or over or by any interested person.
### Chunk 666

1991, c. 64, a. 571. 572. Where the effects of the order of placement cease and no adoption has taken place, the court, even of its own motion, designates the person who is to exercise parental authority over the child; the director of youth protection who was the legal tutor before the order of placement again becomes the legal tutor. 1991, c. 64, a. 572. 573. The court grants adoption on the application of the adopters unless a report indicates that the child has not adapted to his adopting family.
### Chunk 667

In this case or whenever the interest of the child demands it, the court may require any additional proof it considers necessary. The adoption must be granted in accordance with the provisions of the order of placement as to whether a preexisting bond of filiation is recognized or, in the case of an adoption of a person of full age, in accordance with the person’s consent and the application filed. 1991, c. 64, a. 573; 2017, c. 12, s. 26. 573. 1. Where the court, within the framework of the Convention on Protection of Children and Co operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, grants an adoption in Québec of a child habitually residing outside Québec, it issues the certificate provided for in the Convention as soon as the adoption judgment becomes final.
### Chunk 668

2004, c. 3, s. 16; 2016, c. 4, s. 82. 574. The court, where called upon to recognize a decision granting an adoption made outside Québec, ascertains that the rules that apply to consent to adoption and eligibility for adoption have been complied with. Where the decision granting the adoption has been made outside Québec under an agreement entered into by virtue of the Youth Protection Act (chapter P34. 1), the court also verifies that the procedure followed is as provided in the agreement.
### Chunk 669

Even if the adopter has not complied with the provisions of articles 563 and 564, recognition may be granted for serious reasons and if the interest of the child demands it. However, the application shall be accompanied with a psychosocial assessment. 1991, c. 64, a. 574; 2004, c. 3, s. 17; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 27. 574. 1. The authority called on to recognize an act evidencing an Aboriginal customary adoption other than a judgment verifies that the act meets the conditions for recognition of foreign decisions.
### Chunk 670

If such is the case, the authority enters on the act the same statements and notations as an Aboriginal customary adoption certificate and signs the act. The same provisions apply to the court when called on to recognize an act evidencing an Aboriginal customary adoption. 2017, c. 12, s. 28. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 158 of 556 ### Page 159 575. If either of the adopters dies after the order of placement, the court may grant adoption even with regard to the deceased adopter.
### Chunk 671

The court may also recognize a decision granting an adoption made outside Québec notwithstanding the death of the adopter. 1991, c. 64, a. 575; 2004, c. 3, s. 18. 576. The court assigns to the adopted person the surname and given names chosen by the adopter unless, at the request of the adopter or of the adopted person, it allows him to keep his original surname and given names or assigns him a surname consisting of not more than two parts taken from those forming the adopter’s surname or the surnames of the child’s father and mother or parents with whom a preexisting bond of filiation has been recognized.
### Chunk 672

1991, c. 64, a. 576; 2017, c. 12, s. 29; 2022, c. 22, s. 90. DIVISION III EFFECTS OF ADOPTION 577. Adoption confers on the adoptee a filiation which succeeds the person’s preexisting filiations. However, in the case of an adoption by the spouse of the child’s father or mother or of one of his parents, the new filiation only succeeds the established filiation, if any, with the child’s other parent. Although there may be recognition of the adoptee’s preexisting bonds of filiation, he ceases to belong to his family of origin, subject to impediments to marriage or civil union.
### Chunk 673

1991, c. 64, a. 577; 2002, c. 6, s. 32; 2017, c. 12, s. 30; 2022, c. 22, s. 91. 577. 1. When an adoption is granted, the effects of the preexisting filiation cease. The adoptee and the parent of origin lose all rights and are released from all obligations with respect to each other. The tutor, if any, loses all rights and is released from all obligations with respect to the adoptee, except the obligation to render accounts. The same applies when an Aboriginal customary adoption certificate is notified to the registrar of civil status, subject to any provisions to the contrary that are in accordance with Aboriginal custom and specified in the certificate.
### Chunk 674

2017, c. 12, s. 30. 578. Adoption creates the same rights and obligations as filiation by birth. The court may, however, according to circumstances, permit a marriage or civil union in the collateral line between the adopted person and a member of his or her adoptive family. 1991, c. 64, a. 578; 2002, c. 6, s. 33; 2023, c. 13, s. 25. 578. 1. If the parents of an adopted child are of the same sex and where different rights and obligations are assigned by law to the father and to the mother, the parent who is biologically related to the child has the rights and obligations assigned to the father in the case of a male couple and those assigned to the mother in the case of a female couple.
### Chunk 675

The adoptive parent has the rights and obligations assigned by law to the other parent. If neither parent is biologically related to the child, the rights and obligations of each parent are determined in the adoption judgment or in any act which, under the law, produces the effects of adoption in Québec. 2002, c. 6, s. 34; 2017, c. 12, s. 31. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 159 of 556 ### Page 160 579. In the case of an adoption of a child domiciled in Québec by a person also domiciled in Québec, exchanges of information concerning the adoptee and members of his family of origin may be provided for, or personal relations between those persons may be maintained or developed, to the extent that establishing such exchanges or maintaining or developing such relations is in the interest of the adoptee.
### Chunk 676

If the adoptee is 10 years of age or over, his consent must be obtained, unless he is unable to express his will. Those exchanges may take place and those relations may be maintained or developed by any means appropriate to the situation and the persons are not required to be in the physical presence of each other. The terms for the exchanges or relations shall be agreed on in writing between the adopter, as the adoptee’s tutor, or the adoptee 14 years of age or over and the members concerned of the family of origin.
### Chunk 677

Where an adoptee 10 years of age or over, but under 14 years of age, does not consent to exchanging information or to maintaining or developing relations with a parent or grandparent of origin, or if there is a disagreement between the parties in that respect, the exchanges or the maintenance or development of the relations are determined by the court, to the extent that they are in the interest of the adoptee and that they concern persons who are important to him. In all cases, the consent of the adoptee 14 years of age or over is required to provide for such exchanges or for the maintenance or development of such relations and the adoptee may, from that age, put an end to such exchanges or relations without formality, whether or not an order has been issued by the court.
### Chunk 678

1991, c. 64, a. 579; 2002, c. 6, s. 35; 2017, c. 12, s. 32; 2022, c. 22, s. 92. 580. Where one of the adopters dies after the order of placement is made, the adoption produces its effects from the date of the order. 1991, c. 64, a. 580. 581. The recognition of a decision granting an adoption produces the same effects as an adoption judgment rendered in Québec from the time the decision granting the adoption was pronounced outside Québec. The recognition by operation of law of an adoption as provided for in the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption produces the same effects as an adoption judgment rendered in Québec from the time the decision granting the adoption is pronounced, subject to section 9 of the Act to implement the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (chapter M35.
### Chunk 679

1. 3). Recognition of an Aboriginal customary adoption that took place outside Québec, but in Canada, produces, from the date on which the adoption took effect in the child’s State of origin, the same effects as an Aboriginal customary adoption certificate. 1991, c. 64, a. 581; 2004, c. 3, s. 19; 2017, c. 12, s. 33. DIVISION IV CONFIDENTIALITY OF ADOPTION FILES 582. The judicial and administrative files concerning the adoption of a child are confidential and no information contained in them may be revealed except as required by law.
### Chunk 680

However, the court may allow an adoption file to be examined for the purposes of study, teaching, research or a public inquiry, provided that the anonymity of the child, of the parents of origin, of the tutor and of the adopter is preserved. 1991, c. 64, a. 582; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 34. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 160 of 556 ### Page 161 583. An adoptee, including one under 14 years of age who has obtained the approval of his father and mother, of his parents or of his tutor, has the right to obtain, from the authorities responsible under the law for disclosing such information, his original name, the name of his parents of origin, whether or not the bond of filiation has been entered in the original act of birth, and information making it possible for him to contact them.
### Chunk 681

The adoptee also has the right to obtain a copy of his original act of birth and of the judgments concerning the adoption, according to the terms determined by government regulation. Likewise, once the adoptee has reached full age, his parents of origin have the right to obtain the name given to him and information making it possible for them to contact him. No such information may be disclosed, however, if an identity disclosure veto or a contact veto, as the case may be, bars their disclosure.
### Chunk 682

In addition, the communication of a document must be made in keeping with any contact veto registered and the passages providing information making contact with a parent of origin possible must be deleted or redacted accordingly. The authorities that disclose information concerning a parent of origin whose filiation with regard to the adoptee has not been entered in the original act of birth are not liable for any injury which may result from an error not due to their act or omission in the identification of the parent.
### Chunk 683

1991, c. 64, a. 583; 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 93. 583. 0. 1. The descendants in the first degree of an adoptee who are 14 years of age or over may, if the adoptee is deceased, obtain from the authorities responsible under the law for disclosing such information and documents, the same information and the same documents that the adoptee may obtain under this division, subject to the same conditions. 2022, c. 22, s. 94. 583. 1. An identity disclosure veto by a parent of origin, in addition to barring disclosure of that parent’s name, bars disclosure of the adoptee’s original name if it reveals that parent’s identity.
### Chunk 684

2017, c. 12, s. 35. 583. 2. When only contact is barred, or when it is authorized on conditions, the name of the person sought or the adoptee’s original name is disclosed on the condition that the contact veto or the conditions on which contact is authorized be complied with. An adoptee or a parent of origin who obtains the information on that condition but violates the condition is liable toward the other person and may also be required to pay punitive damages. 2017, c. 12, s. 35.
### Chunk 685

583. 3. (Repealed). 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2020, c. 11, s. 63; 2022, c. 22, s. 95. 583. 4. A parent of origin may register an identity disclosure veto in the 30 days following the birth of the child. In such a case, the child’s identity is protected, by operation of law, from that parent. When the first request for information about the parent of origin is made, the parent of origin must be informed of it so as to have the opportunity to maintain or withdraw the veto. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 161 of 556 ### Page 162 Such an identity disclosure veto by the parent of origin ceases to have effect on the adoptee’s eighteenth birthday.
### Chunk 686

The same applies to the identity protection granted, by operation of law, to the adoptee where such a veto is registered by the parent of origin. 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 96. 583. 5. In the case of an adoption that took place before 16 June 2018, if the adoptee has not yet expressed his will concerning disclosure of information about him to the authorities responsible under the law for disclosing such information, his identity is protected by operation of law. 2017, c.
### Chunk 687

12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 97. 583. 6. Whether or not the bond of filiation has been entered in the original act of birth, an adoptee or a parent of origin may, at any time before his identity is disclosed, register a contact veto barring any contact between them or, where applicable, in the case of the parent of origin, barring any contact between the latter and the adoptee’s descendants in the first degree, or may allow contact subject to conditions he determines. 2017, c. 12, s.
### Chunk 688

35; 2022, c. 22, s. 98. 583. 7. Before the identity of the person sought is disclosed, he must be informed of the request for information about him and given the opportunity to register a contact veto or to maintain or withdraw a veto already registered by him. The same applies in the case of a parent of origin whose identity would be revealed if the adoptee’s original name were disclosed to the adoptee. If the person sought is untraceable or incapable of expressing his will, disclosure of his identity entails, by operation of law, a contact veto.
### Chunk 689

In the event the person sought is found or again becomes capable of expressing his will, he must be given the opportunity to maintain or withdraw the veto. 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 99. 583. 8. If a veto is registered by operation of law, the person in whose behalf the veto is registered must, at the time the first request for information about him is made, be informed of the request and given the opportunity to maintain or withdraw the veto. If the person is untraceable or incapable of expressing his will, the veto registered by operation of law is maintained.
### Chunk 690

In the event the person is found or again becomes capable of expressing his will, he must be given the opportunity to maintain or withdraw the veto. 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 100. 583. 9. An identity disclosure veto or a contact veto may be withdrawn at any time. An identity disclosure veto ceases to have effect on the first anniversary of the death of the person in whose behalf it was registered. 2017, c. 12, s. 35. 583. 10. Unless the parent of origin has registered an identity disclosure veto, the adoptee, including one under 14 years of age who has obtained the approval of his father and mother, of his parents or of his tutor, has the right to obtain, from the authorities responsible under the law for disclosing such information, the names of his brothers or sisters of origin who have reached full age, whether adopted or not, and those of his grandparents of origin and, to the extent that they consent to it, the information making it possible for the adoptee to contact them.

### Chunk 692

2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 101. 583. 11. It is the adopter’s responsibility to inform the child that he was adopted. It is also the adopter’s responsibility to inform the child of the rules concerning identity disclosure and the rules for establishing contact. 2017, c. 12, s. 35. 583. 12. In the case of an adoption of a child domiciled outside Québec, the identity of the parent of origin and the documents to which the adoptee is entitled are communicated to the adoptee, to the extent that the law of the child’s State of origin does not provide for different rules.
### Chunk 693

Disclosure of the identity of the adoptee or of another person sought and of information making it possible to contact the adoptee, the parent of origin or another person sought is subject to the consent of that person, unless, as the case may be, the law of the child’s State of origin provides otherwise. 2017, c. 12, s. 35; 2022, c. 22, s. 102. 584. Where a physician is of the opinion that the health of the adoptee, of a parent of origin or of any of their close relatives genetically linked to them warrants it, the physician may obtain the necessary medical information from the medical authorities concerned, subject to the consent of the person whose information is requested.
### Chunk 694

In the absence of such consent, court authorization is required to obtain such information. The anonymity of the persons concerned must be preserved. 1991, c. 64, a. 584; I. N. 20140501; 2017, c. 12, s. 36; 2022, c. 22, s. 103. 584. 1. This division applies to children who are eligible for adoption because consent to their adoption has been given, to children who are eligible for adoption because they have been judicially declared eligible for adoption, and to their parents, even if the children have never been adopted.
### Chunk 695

2017, c. 12, s. 37. TITLE THREE OBLIGATION OF SUPPORT 585. Married or civil union spouses, and relatives in the direct line in the first degree, owe each other support. 1991, c. 64, a. 585; 1996, c. 28, s. 1; 2002, c. 6, s. 36. 586. Proceedings for the support of a minor child may be instituted by the holder of parental authority, his tutor, or any person who has custody of him, according to the circumstances. A parent providing in part for the needs of a child of full age unable to support himself may institute support proceedings on the child’s behalf, unless the child objects.
### Chunk 696

The court may order the support payable to the person who has custody of the child or to the parent of the child of full age who instituted the proceedings on the child’s behalf. 1991, c. 64, a. 586; 2004, c. 5, s. 2. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 163 of 556 ### Page 164 587. In awarding support, account is taken of the needs and means of the parties, their circumstances and, as the case may be, the time needed by the creditor of support to acquire sufficient autonomy.
### Chunk 697

1991, c. 64, a. 587. 587. 1. As regards the support owed to a child by his parents, the basic parental contribution, as determined pursuant to the rules for the determination of child support payments adopted under the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01), is presumed to meet the needs of the child and to be in proportion to the means of the parents. The basic parental contribution may be increased having regard to certain expenses relating to the child which are specified in the rules, to the extent that such expenses are reasonable considering the needs and means of the parents and child.
### Chunk 698

1996, c. 68, s. 1; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 587. 2. The support to be provided by a parent for his child is equal to that parent’s share of the basic parental contribution, increased, where applicable, having regard to specified expenses relating to the child. The court may, however, increase or reduce the level of support where warranted by the value of either parent’s assets or the extent of the resources available to the child, or to take account of either parent’s obligation to provide support to children not named in the application, if the court considers the obligation entails hardship for that parent.
### Chunk 699

The court may also increase or reduce the level of support if it is of the opinion that, in the special circumstances of the case, not doing so would entail undue hardship for either parent. Such hardship may be due, among other reasons, to the costs involved in exercising visiting rights in relation to the child, an obligation to provide support to persons other than children or debts reasonably incurred to meet family needs. 1996, c. 68, s. 1; 2004, c. 5, s. 3; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c.
### Chunk 700

4, s. 84. 587. 3. Parents may make a private agreement stipulating a level of child support that departs from the level which would be required to be provided under the rules for the determination of child support payments, subject to the court being satisfied that the needs of the child are adequately provided for. 1996, c. 68, s. 1. 588. The court may award provisional support to the creditor of support for the duration of the proceedings. It may also award a provision to the creditor of support to cover the costs of the proceedings.
### Chunk 701

1991, c. 64, a. 588; 2016, c. 4, s. 85. 589. Support is payable as a pension; the court may, by way of exception, replace or complete that support by a lump sum payable all at once or by instalments. 1991, c. 64, a. 589; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 86. 590. If support is payable as a pension, it is indexed by operation of law on 1 January each year, in accordance with the annual Pension Index determined pursuant to section 119 of the Act respecting the Québec Pension Plan (chapter R9), in order to maintain the real monetary value of the claim resulting from the judgment awarding support.
### Chunk 702

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 164 of 556 ### Page 165 However, where the application of the index brings about a serious imbalance between the needs of the creditor and the means of the debtor, the court may, in exercising its jurisdiction, either fix another basis of indexation or order that the claim not be indexed. 1991, c. 64, a. 590; I. N. 20151101. 591. The court, if it considers it necessary, may order the debtor to furnish sufficient security beyond the legal hypothec for payment of support, or order the constitution of a trust to secure such payment.
### Chunk 703

1991, c. 64, a. 591. 592. If the debtor offers to take the creditor of support into his home, he may, if circumstances permit, be dispensed from paying all or part of the support. 1991, c. 64, a. 592. 593. The creditor may pursue a remedy against one of the debtors of support or against several of them simultaneously. The court fixes the amount of support that each of the debtors sued or impleaded shall pay. 1991, c. 64, a. 593. 594. The judgment awarding support, whether or not the support is indexed or recalculated, may be reviewed by the court whenever warranted by circumstances.
### Chunk 704

However, a judgment awarding payment of a lump sum may be reviewed only if it has not been executed. 1991, c. 64, a. 594; 2012, c. 20, s. 42. 595. Child support may be claimed for needs that existed before the application; however, child support cannot be claimed for needs that existed more than three years before the application, unless the debtor parent behaved in a reprehensible manner towards the other parent or the child. If the support is not claimed for a child, it may nevertheless be claimed for needs that existed before the application, but not for needs that existed more than one year before the application; in such a case, the creditor must prove that it was in fact impossible to act sooner, unless he put the debtor in default within one year before the application, in which case support is awarded from the date of default.
### Chunk 705

1991, c. 64, a. 595; 2012, c. 20, s. 43; I. N. 20151101. 596. A debtor from whom arrears are claimed may plead a change, after judgment, in his condition or in that of his creditor and be released from payment of the whole or a part of them. However, in no case where the arrears claimed have been due for over six months may the debtor be released from payment of them unless he shows that it was impossible for him to exercise his right to obtain a review of the judgment fixing the support.
### Chunk 706

1991, c. 64, a. 596; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. 596. 1. In order to update the amount of support payable to their child, parents must, on the request of one of them and no more than once a year, or as required by the court, keep each other mutually informed of the state of their respective incomes and provide, to that end, the documents determined by the rules for the determination of child support payments adopted under the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01).

### Chunk 707

2012, c. 20, s. 44; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 787; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). TITLE FOUR PARENTAL AUTHORITY 597. Every child, regardless of age, owes respect to his father and mother or to his parents. 1991, c. 64, a. 597; 2022, c. 22, s. 104. 598. A child remains subject to the authority of his father and mother or of his parents until his majority or emancipation. 1991, c. 64, a. 598; 2022, c. 22, s. 105. 599. The father and mother or the parents have the rights and duties of custody, supervision and education of their children.
### Chunk 708

They shall maintain their children. They exercise their authority without any violence. 1991, c. 64, a. 599; 2022, c. 22, s. 106. 600. The father and mother or the parents exercise parental authority together. If either of them dies, is deprived of parental authority or is unable to express their will, parental authority is exercised by the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 600; 2022, c. 22, s. 107. 601. The person having parental authority may delegate the custody, supervision or education of the child.
### Chunk 709

1991, c. 64, a. 601. 602. No unemancipated minor may leave his domicile without the consent of the person having parental authority. 1991, c. 64, a. 602. 603. Where the father or the mother or the parent performs alone any act of authority concerning their child, they are, with regard to third persons in good faith, presumed to be acting with the consent of the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 603; 2022, c. 22, s. 108. 603. 1. The father or the mother or the parent may, without the other parent’s consent, due to a situation of family violence, which includes spousal violence, or of sexual violence, caused by that other parent, request health services or social services, including psychosocial support services, recognized by the Minister of Justice, for their child.
### Chunk 710

To that end, the father or the mother or the parent must first obtain an attestation from a public servant or public officer designated by the Minister of Justice who, on examining the affidavit of the father, mother or parent attesting that there exists such a situation of violence and other factual elements or documents supporting that affidavit provided by persons in contact with the persons who are victims, considers that the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 166 of 556 ### Page 167 request is a measure beneficial to the health and safety of the child.
### Chunk 711

The public servant or public officer must act promptly. 2022, c. 22, s. 109. See M. O. 20234997, 20230517, (2023) 155 G. O. 2, 1016. 604. In the case of difficulties relating to the exercise of parental authority, the person having parental authority may refer the matter to the court, which will decide in the interest of the child after fostering the conciliation of the parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 604. 605. Whether custody is entrusted to one of the parents or to a third person, for whatever reason, the father and mother or the parents retain the right to supervise the maintenance and education of the children, and are bound to contribute thereto in proportion to their means.
### Chunk 712

1991, c. 64, a. 605; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 22, s. 110. 606. The court may, for a grave reason and in the interest of the child, including the presence of family violence, which includes spousal violence, or sexual violence, on the application of any interested person, declare the father and mother or the parents either of them, or a third person on whom parental authority may have been conferred, to be deprived of such authority. The deprivation of parental authority is, however, declared with regard to a person where a judgment that has become final finds the person guilty of a criminal offence of a sexual nature involving a child or finds the person liable for injury resulting from an act which could constitute such an offence, unless it is shown that such a measure would be contrary to the interest of that person’s child.
### Chunk 713

Where such a measure is not required by the situation but action is nevertheless necessary, the court may declare, instead, the withdrawal of an attribute of parental authority or of its exercise. A direct application for withdrawal may also be made to the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 606; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 87; 2022, c. 22, s. 111; 2023, c. 13, s. 27. 607. The court may, in declaring deprivation or withdrawal of an attribute of parental authority or of its exercise, designate the person who is to exercise parental authority or an attribute thereof; it may also, where applicable, obtain the advice of the tutorship council before designating the person or, if required in the interest of the child, appointing a tutor.
### Chunk 714

1991, c. 64, a. 607; I. N. 20140501. 608. Deprivation extends to all minor children born at the time of the judgment, unless the court decides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 608. 609. Deprivation entails the exemption of the child from the obligation to provide support, unless the court decides otherwise. However, where circumstances warrant it, the exemption may be lifted after the child reaches full age. 1991, c. 64, a. 609. 610. A father or mother or a parent who has been deprived of parental authority or from whom an attribute of parental authority has been withdrawn may have the withdrawn authority restored, provided he or she alleges new circumstances, subject to the provisions governing adoption.
### Chunk 715

1991, c. 64, a. 610; 2022, c. 22, s. 112. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 167 of 556 ### Page 168 611. Personal relations between the child and his grandparents may be maintained or developed to the extent that it is in the child’s interest and that, if the child is 10 years of age or over, he consents to it, unless he is unable to express his will. Such relations may, on the same conditions, be maintained with the former spouse of the child’s father, mother or parent, provided that person is important to the child.
### Chunk 716

Those relations may be maintained or developed by any means appropriate to the situation and the persons are not required to be in the physical presence of each other. The terms governing such relations may be agreed on in writing between the child’s father, mother or parent as tutor, the child’s tutor, if applicable, or the child 14 years of age or over, and the child’s grandparents or the former spouse of his father, mother or parent, as the case may be. If a child 10 years of age or over, but under 14 years of age, does not give his consent or if there is a disagreement between the parties, maintenance or development of those relations is determined by the court.
### Chunk 717

In all cases, the consent of a child 14 years of age or over is required for such relations to be maintained or developed and the child may, from that age, put an end to them without further formality, whether or not an order has been issued by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 611; 2022, c. 22, s. 113. 612. Decisions concerning the children may be reviewed at any time by the court, if warranted by circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 612. BOOK THREE SUCCESSIONS TITLE ONE OPENING OF SUCCESSIONS AND QUALITIES REQUIRED TO INHERIT 1991, c.
### Chunk 718

64, Tit. One; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER I OPENING OF SUCCESSIONS 613. The succession of a person opens by his death, at the place of his last domicile. The succession devolves according to the prescriptions of the law unless the deceased has, by testamentary provisions, provided otherwise for the devolution of his property. Gifts mortis causa are, in that respect, testamentary provisions. 1991, c. 64, a. 613; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 614. In settling succession to property, the law considers neither the origin nor the nature of the property; all the property constitutes a single patrimony.
### Chunk 719

1991, c. 64, a. 614; I. N. 20140501. 615. When a person dies leaving property situated outside Québec or claims against persons not residing in Québec, letters of verification may be obtained in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). 1991, c. 64, a. 615; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 168 of 556 ### Page 169 616. Where persons die and it is impossible to determine which survived the other, they are deemed to have died at the same time if at least one of them is called to the succession of the other.
### Chunk 720

The succession of each then devolves to the persons who would have been called to take it in their place. 1991, c. 64, a. 616; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II QUALITIES REQUIRED TO INHERIT 1991, c. 64, c. II; I. N. 20140501. 617. Natural persons who exist at the time the succession opens, including absentees presumed to be alive at that time and children conceived but yet unborn, if they are born alive and viable, may inherit. In the case of a substitution or trust, persons who have the required qualities when the provision produces its effect in their regard may also inherit.
### Chunk 721

1991, c. 64, a. 617; I. N. 20151101. 618. The State may receive by will. Legal persons may receive by will such property as they may legally hold. A trustee may receive a legacy intended for the trust or a legacy to be used to accomplish the object of the trust. 1991, c. 64, a. 618. 619. A successor to whom an intestate succession devolves, or who receives a universal legacy or a legacy by general title by will, is an heir from the opening of the succession, provided he accepts it.
### Chunk 722

1991, c. 64, a. 619; I. N. 20140501. 620. The following persons are unworthy of inheriting by operation of law: (1) a person convicted of making an attempt on the life of the deceased; (2) a person deprived of parental authority over his child, with the exemption for the child from the obligation to provide support, with respect to that child’s succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 620; I. N. 20140501. 621. The following persons may be declared unworthy of inheriting: (1) a person who has subjected the deceased to ill treatment or who has otherwise behaved towards him in a seriously reprehensible manner; (2) a person who has concealed, altered or destroyed in bad faith the will of the deceased; (3) a person who has hindered the testator in the drawing up, amendment or revocation of his will.
### Chunk 723

1991, c. 64, a. 621; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 88. 622. An heir is not unworthy of inheriting nor subject to being declared so if the deceased knew the cause of unworthiness and yet conferred a benefit on him or did not modify the liberality when he could have done so. 1991, c. 64, a. 622. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 169 of 556 ### Page 170 623. Any successor may, within one year after the opening of the succession or becoming aware of a cause of unworthiness, apply to the court to have an heir declared unworthy of inheriting if that heir is not unworthy by operation of law.
### Chunk 724

1991, c. 64, a. 623; I. N. 20140501. 624. The married or civil union spouse in good faith of the deceased inherits if the marriage or civil union is declared null after the death. 1991, c. 64, a. 624; 2002, c. 6, s. 37; I. N. 20140501. TITLE TWO TRANSMISSION OF SUCCESSIONS CHAPTER I SEISIN 625. The heirs are seized, by the death of the deceased or by the event which gives effect to a legacy, of the patrimony of the deceased, subject to the provisions on the liquidation of successions.
### Chunk 725

Subject to the exceptions provided in this Book, the heirs are not liable for the obligations of the deceased in excess of the value of the property they take, and they retain their right to demand payment of their claims from the succession. The heirs are seized of the rights of action of the deceased against the author of any infringement of his personality rights or against the author’s representatives. 1991, c. 64, a. 625; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER II PETITION OF INHERITANCE AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SUCCESSION 626.
### Chunk 726

A successor is entitled to have his heirship recognized at any time within 10 years from the opening of the succession to which he claims to be entitled or from the day his right arises. 1991, c. 64, a. 626. 627. An apparent heir is obliged, by the recognition of the heirship of the successor, to restore everything he has received from the succession without right, in accordance with the rules in the Book on Obligations relating to restitution of prestations. 1991, c. 64, a. 627; I.
### Chunk 727

N. 20151101. 628. Any person who is unworthy of inheriting and who has received property from the succession is deemed to be an apparent heir in bad faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 628; I. N. 20140501. 629. Obligations of the deceased discharged by the apparent heirs otherwise than out of property from the succession are reimbursed by the true heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 629. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 170 of 556 ### Page 171 CHAPTER III THE RIGHT OF OPTION DIVISION I DELIBERATION AND OPTION 630.
### Chunk 728

Every successor has the right to accept or to renounce the succession. The option is indivisible. However, a successor called to the succession in several ways has a separate option for each. 1991, c. 64, a. 630. 631. No one may exercise his option with respect to a succession not yet opened or make any stipulation with respect to such a succession, even with the consent of the person whose succession it is. 1991, c. 64, a. 631; I. N. 20140501. 632. A successor has six months from the day his right arises to deliberate and exercise his option.
### Chunk 729

The period is extended, by operation of law, by as many days as necessary to afford him 60 days from closure of the inventory. During the period for deliberation, no judgment may be rendered against the successor as an heir unless he has already accepted the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 632; I. N. 20140501. 633. If a successor aware of his heirship does not renounce within the period for deliberation, he is presumed to have accepted unless the period has been extended by the court.
### Chunk 730

If a successor is unaware of his heirship, he may be compelled to exercise his option within the time determined by the court. If a successor does not exercise his option within the time determined by the court, he is presumed to have renounced. 1991, c. 64, a. 633; I. N. 20140501. 634. If a successor renounces within the period for deliberation fixed in article 632, the lawful expenses incurred to that time are borne by the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 634. 635. If a successor dies before exercising his option, his heirs deliberate and exercise the option within the period allotted to them to deliberate and exercise their option regarding the succession of their predecessor in title.
### Chunk 731

Each of the heirs of the successor exercises his option separately; the share of an heir who renounces accrues to the coheirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 635; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 636. A person may cause an option he has exercised to be annulled on the grounds and within the time prescribed for invoking nullity of contracts. 1991, c. 64, a. 636. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 171 of 556 ### Page 172 DIVISION II ACCEPTANCE 637.
### Chunk 732

Acceptance is express or tacit. It may also result from the law. Acceptance is express where the successor formally assumes the title or quality of heir; it is tacit where the successor performs an act that necessarily implies his intention of accepting. 1991, c. 64, a. 637. 638. A succession devolving to a minor, to a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate or to an absentee is deemed to be accepted, except where it is renounced within the time for deliberation and exercise of the option, (1) in the case of an unemancipated minor, a person of full age under tutorship or an absentee, by the representative of the successor with the authorization of the tutorship council; (2) in the case of an emancipated minor, by the successor himself, assisted by his tutor; (3) in the case of a person of full age under a protection mandate, by the mandatary.
### Chunk 733

In no case is the minor, the person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate or the absentee liable for the payment of debts of the succession in excess of the value of the property he takes. 1991, c. 64, a. 638; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 64. 639. The fact that the successor exempts the liquidator from making an inventory, or mingles property of the succession with his personal property after the death, entails acceptance of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 734

639; I. N. 20140501. 640. The succession is presumed to be accepted where the successor, knowing that the liquidator refuses or neglects to make the inventory, himself neglects to make the inventory or to apply to the court to have the liquidator replaced or for an order to have him make the inventory within 60 days after expiry of the six months for deliberation. 1991, c. 64, a. 640; I. N. 20140501. 641. The transfer by a person of his rights in a succession by gratuitous or onerous title entails acceptance.
### Chunk 735

The same rule applies to renunciation in favour of one or more coheirs, even by gratuitous title, and to renunciation by onerous title, even though it be in favour of all the coheirs without distinction. 1991, c. 64, a. 641. 642. Mere conservatory acts and acts of supervision and provisional administration do not, by themselves, entail acceptance of the succession. The same rule applies to an act rendered necessary by exceptional circumstances which the successor performs in the interest of the succession.
### Chunk 736

1991, c. 64, a. 642. 643. The distribution of the clothing, personal papers, medals and diplomas of the deceased and family souvenirs does not by itself entail acceptance of the succession if it is done with the agreement of all the successors. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 172 of 556 ### Page 173 Acceptance by a successor of the transmission in his favour of a site intended for a body or ashes does not entail acceptance of the succession.
### Chunk 737

1991, c. 64, a. 643; I. N. 20151101. 643. 1. Remittance of a share of the balance of a demand deposit account to the surviving coholder under section 3 of the Act respecting remittance of deposits of money to account coholders who are spouses or former spouses (chapter R20. 2) that exceeds the share to which the coholder is entitled does not by itself entail acceptance of the succession. 2022, c. 22, s. 114. 644. If a succession includes perishable property, the successor may, before the designation of a liquidator, sell it by agreement or, if he cannot find a buyer in due time, give it to charitable institutions or distribute it among the successors, without implying acceptance on his part.
### Chunk 738

He may also alienate property which, although not perishable, is expensive to preserve or is likely to depreciate rapidly. In this case, he acts as an administrator of the property of others. 1991, c. 64, a. 644; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 89. 645. Acceptance confirms the transmission which took place by operation of law at the time of death. 1991, c. 64, a. 645. DIVISION III RENUNCIATION 646. Renunciation is express. It may also result from the law. Express renunciation is made by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded.
### Chunk 739

1991, c. 64, a. 646. 647. A person who renounces is deemed never to have been a successor. 1991, c. 64, a. 647. 648. A successor may renounce the succession provided that he has not performed any act entailing acceptance and that no judgment having become final has been rendered against him as an heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 648; 2016, c. 4, s. 90. 649. A successor who has renounced the succession retains his right to accept it for 10 years from the day that right arose, provided the succession has not been accepted by another.
### Chunk 740

Acceptance is made by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded. The heir takes the succession in its actual condition at that time and subject to the rights acquired by third persons in the property of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 649; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 650. A successor who has been unaware of his heirship or has not made it known for 10 years from the day his right arose is deemed to have renounced the succession. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 741

650. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 173 of 556 ### Page 174 651. A successor who, in bad faith, has abstracted or concealed property of the succession or failed to include property in the inventory is deemed to have renounced the succession notwithstanding any prior acceptance. 1991, c. 64, a. 651. 652. The creditors of a successor who renounces may, if the renunciation is prejudicial to their rights, apply within one year to the court for a declaration that the renunciation may not be set up against them, and accept the succession in the place and stead of their debtor.
### Chunk 742

The acceptance has effect only in their favour, and only up to the amount of their claim. It has no effect in favour of the successor who renounced. 1991, c. 64, a. 652; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. TITLE THREE LEGAL DEVOLUTION OF SUCCESSIONS CHAPTER I HEIRSHIP 653. Unless otherwise provided by testamentary provisions, a succession devolves to the surviving married or civil union spouse and relatives of the deceased, in the order and according to the rules provided in this Title.
### Chunk 743

Where there is no heir, it falls to the State. 1991, c. 64, a. 653; 2002, c. 6, s. 38; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 654. The surviving spouse’s heirship is not dependent on the renunciation of his or her rights and benefits by reason of the marriage or civil union. 1991, c. 64, a. 654; 2002, c. 6, s. 39. CHAPTER II RELATIONSHIP 655. Relationship is based on bonds of filiation by birth or of filiation by adoption. 1991, c. 64, a. 655; 2023, c. 13, s.
### Chunk 744

28. 656. The degree of relationship is determined by the number of generations, each forming one degree. The series of degrees forms the direct line or the collateral line. 1991, c. 64, a. 656; I. N. 20151101. 657. The direct line is the series of degrees between persons descended one from another. The number of degrees in the direct line is equal to the number of generations between the successor and the deceased. 1991, c. 64, a. 657. 658. The direct line of descent connects a person with his descendants; the direct line of ascent connects him with his ancestors.

1991, c. 64, a. 658. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 174 of 556 ### Page 175 658. 1. A child born as a result of sexual assault is considered as the descendant in the first degree of the person who committed the assault, despite the absence of a bond of filiation with regard to that person, for the purposes of the devolution of that person’s succession and of the succession of that person’s relatives. Sexual assault may be proved, among other means, by the production of a judgment recognizing its existence.
### Chunk 746

2023, c. 13, s. 29. 658. 2. For the purposes of article 658. 1, where the sexual assault is proved, the court may order the analysis of a sample of a bodily substance so that the genetic profile of the person who committed the sexual assault may be established. The court determines conditions for the sampletaking and analysis that are as respectful as possible of the physical integrity of the person concerned or of the body of the deceased. These conditions include the nature and the date and place of the sampletaking, the identity of the expert charged with taking and analyzing the sample, the use of any sample taken and the confidentiality of the analysis results.
### Chunk 747

The court may draw a negative presumption from an unjustified refusal to submit to the analysis ordered by the court. 2023, c. 13, s. 29. 659. The collateral line is the series of degrees between persons descended not one from another but from a common ancestor. In the collateral line, the number of degrees is equal to the number of generations between the successor and the common ancestor and between the common ancestor and the deceased. 1991, c. 64, a. 659. CHAPTER III REPRESENTATION 660.
### Chunk 748

Representation is a favour granted by law by which a relative is called to a succession which his ascendant, who is a closer relative of the deceased, would have taken but is unable to take himself, having died previously or at the same time, or being unworthy. 1991, c. 64, a. 660; I. N. 20140501. 661. There is no limit to representation in the direct line of descent. Representation is allowed whether the children of the deceased compete with the descendants of a represented child, or whether, all the children of the deceased being themselves deceased or unworthy, their descendants are in equal or unequal degrees of relationship to each other.
### Chunk 749

1991, c. 64, a. 661. 662. Representation does not take place in favour of ascendants, the nearer ascendant in each line excluding the more distant. 1991, c. 64, a. 662. 663. In the collateral line, representation takes place, between privileged collaterals, in favour of the descendants in the first degree of the brothers and sisters of the deceased, whether or not they compete with CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 175 of 556 ### Page 176 them and, between ordinary collaterals, in favour of the other descendants of the brothers and sisters of the deceased in other degrees, whether they are in equal or unequal degrees of relationship to each other.
### Chunk 750

1991, c. 64, a. 663. 664. No person who has renounced a succession may be represented, but a person whose succession has been renounced may be represented. 1991, c. 64, a. 664. 665. In all cases where representation is permitted, partition is effected by roots. If one root has several branches, the subdivision is also made by roots in each branch, and the members of the same branch share among themselves by heads. 1991, c. 64, a. 665. CHAPTER IV ORDER OF DEVOLUTION OF SUCCESSIONS DIVISION I DEVOLUTION TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE AND TO DESCENDANTS 666.
### Chunk 751

If the deceased leaves a spouse and descendants, the succession devolves to them. The spouse takes onethird of the succession and the descendants, the other twothirds. 1991, c. 64, a. 666. 667. Where there is no spouse, the entire succession devolves to the descendants. 1991, c. 64, a. 667. 668. If the descendants who inherit are all in the same degree and called in their own right, they share in equal portions and by heads. If there is representation, they share by roots.
### Chunk 752

1991, c. 64, a. 668. 669. Unless there is representation, the descendant in the closest degree takes the share of the descendants, to the exclusion of all the others. 1991, c. 64, a. 669. DIVISION II DEVOLUTION TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE AND TO PRIVILEGED ASCENDANTS OR COLLATERALS 670. The father and mother or the parents of the deceased are privileged ascendants. The brothers and sisters of the deceased and their descendants in the first degree are privileged collaterals. 1991, c.
### Chunk 753

64, a. 670; 2022, c. 22, s. 115. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 176 of 556 ### Page 177 671. Where there are neither descendants, privileged ascendants nor privileged collaterals, the entire succession devolves to the surviving spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 671. 672. Where there are no descendants, twothirds of the succession devolves to the surviving spouse and onethird to the privileged ascendants. 1991, c. 64, a. 672. 673. Where there are no descendants and no privileged ascendants, twothirds of the succession devolves to the surviving spouse and onethird to the privileged collaterals.
### Chunk 754

1991, c. 64, a. 673. 674. Where there are no descendants and no surviving spouse, the succession is partitioned equally between the privileged ascendants and the privileged collaterals. Where there are no privileged ascendants, the privileged collaterals inherit the entire succession, and vice versa. 1991, c. 64, a. 674. 675. Where the privileged ascendants inherit, they share equally; where only one of the privileged ascendants inherits, he takes the share that would have devolved to the other.
### Chunk 755

1991, c. 64, a. 675. 676. Where the privileged collaterals who inherit are fully related by blood to the deceased, they share equally or by roots, as the case may be. Where this is not the case, the share which devolves to them is divided equally between the paternal line and the maternal line of the deceased or the lines related to each of his parents; persons fully related by blood partake in both lines and those half related by blood partake each in his own line. If the privileged collaterals are in one line only, they inherit the entire succession to the exclusion of all other ascendants and ordinary collaterals in the other line.
### Chunk 756

1991, c. 64, a. 676; 2022, c. 22, s. 116. DIVISION III DEVOLUTION TO ORDINARY ASCENDANTS AND COLLATERALS 677. The ordinary ascendants and collaterals are not called to the succession unless the deceased left no spouse, no descendants and no privileged ascendants or collaterals. 1991, c. 64, a. 677. 678. If the ordinary collaterals include descendants of the privileged collaterals, these descendants take onehalf of the succession and the other half devolves to the ascendants and the other collaterals.
### Chunk 757

Where there are no descendants of privileged collaterals, the entire succession devolves to the ascendants and the other collaterals, and vice versa. 1991, c. 64, a. 678. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 177 of 556 ### Page 178 679. The succession devolving to the ordinary ascendants and the other ordinary collaterals of the deceased is divided equally between the paternal and maternal lines or the lines related to each of the parents. In each line, the persons who inherit share by heads.
### Chunk 758

1991, c. 64, a. 679; 2016, c. 4, s. 91; 2022, c. 22, s. 117. 680. In each line, the ascendant in the second degree takes the share allotted to his line, to the exclusion of the other ordinary ascendants or collaterals. Where in one line there is no ascendant in the second degree, the share allotted to that line devolves to the closest ordinary collaterals descended from that ascendant. 1991, c. 64, a. 680. 681. Where in one line there are no ordinary collaterals descended from the ascendants in the second degree, the share allotted to that line devolves to the ascendants in the third degree or, if there are none, to the closest ordinary collaterals descended from them, and so on until no relatives within the degrees of succession remain.
### Chunk 759

1991, c. 64, a. 681. 682. If there are no relatives within the degrees of succession in one line, the relatives in the other line inherit the entire succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 682. 683. Relatives beyond the eighth degree do not inherit. 1991, c. 64, a. 683. CHAPTER V THE SURVIVAL OF THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SUPPORT 684. Every creditor of support may within six months after the death claim a financial contribution from the succession as support. The right exists even where the creditor is an heir or a legatee by particular title or where the right to support was not exercised before the date of the death, but does not exist in favour of a person unworthy of inheriting from the deceased.
### Chunk 760

1991, c. 64, a. 684. 685. The contribution is made in the form of a lump sum payable all at once or by instalments. The contribution made to the creditors of support, with the exception of that made to the former spouse of the deceased who was in fact receiving support at the time of the death, is fixed with the concurrence of the liquidator of the succession acting with the consent of the heirs and legatees by particular title or, failing agreement, by the court. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 761

685; 2016, c. 4, s. 92. 686. In fixing the contribution, the needs and means of the creditor of support, his circumstances and the time he needs to acquire sufficient autonomy or, if he was in fact receiving support from the deceased at the time of the death, the amount of the instalments that had been fixed by the court for the payment of the support or of the lump sum awarded as support are taken into account. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 178 of 556 ### Page 179 Account is also taken of the assets of the succession, the benefits derived from the succession by the creditor of support, the needs and means of the heirs and legatees by particular title and, where that is the case, the right to support which may be claimed by other persons.
### Chunk 762

1991, c. 64, a. 686; I. N. 20140501. 687. Where the contribution is claimed by the spouse or a descendant, the value of the liberalities made by the deceased by act inter vivos during the three years preceding the death and those having the death as a term are considered to be part of the succession for the fixing of the contribution. 1991, c. 64, a. 687; 2016, c. 4, s. 93. 688. The contribution granted to the spouse or to a descendant may not exceed the difference between one half of the share he could have claimed had the entire succession, including the value of the liberalities, devolved according to law, and what he receives from the succession.
### Chunk 763

The contribution granted to the former spouse is equal to the value of 12 months’ support, and that granted to other creditors of support is equal to the value of six months’ support; however, in neither case may such a contribution, even where the creditor was in fact receiving support from the deceased at the time the succession opened, exceed the lesser of the value of 12 or six months’ support and 10% of the value of the succession including, where that is the case, the value of the liberalities.
### Chunk 764

1991, c. 64, a. 688; I. N. 20140501. 689. Where the assets of the succession are insufficient to make full payment of the contributions due to the spouse or to a descendant, as a result of liberalities made by acts inter vivos during the three years preceding the death or having the death as a term, the court may order the liberalities reduced. Liberalities to which the spouse or descendant consented may not be reduced, however, and those he has received shall be imputed to his claim.
### Chunk 765

1991, c. 64, a. 689; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 94. 690. Any alienation, security or charge granted by the deceased for a prestation clearly of smaller value than that of the property at the time it was made is presumed to be a liberality. 1991, c. 64, a. 690. 691. Benefits under a retirement plan contemplated in article 415 or under a contract of insurance of persons, where these benefits would have been part of the succession or would have been paid to the creditor had it not been for the designation of a subrogated holder or a beneficiary, by the deceased, during the three years preceding the death, are considered to be liberalities.
### Chunk 766

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, rights conferred by benefits under any such plan or contract may be transferred or seized for the payment of support due under this chapter. 1991, c. 64, a. 691; I. N. 20140501. 692. The cost of education or maintenance and customary presents are not considered to be liberalities unless, considering the means of the deceased, they are manifestly exaggerated. 1991, c. 64, a. 692. 693. Reduction of the liberalities takes place against one of the beneficiaries or several of them simultaneously.
### Chunk 767

If need be, the court fixes the share payable by each beneficiary sued or impleaded. 1991, c. 64, a. 693; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 179 of 556 ### Page 180 694. Payment of the reduction is made, failing agreement between the parties, on the conditions determined by the court and on the terms and conditions of guarantee and payment it fixes. Payment in kind may not be ordered, but the debtor may be discharged at any time by handing over the property.
### Chunk 768

1991, c. 64, a. 694; I. N. 20140501. 695. Property is valued according to its condition at the time of the liberality and its value at the opening of the succession; if property has been alienated, its value at the time of alienation or, in the case of reinvestment, the value of the replacement property on the day the succession opened is the value considered. Liberalities by way of a usufruct, right of use, annuity or income from a trust are taken into account at their capital value on the day the succession opened.
### Chunk 769

1991, c. 64, a. 695; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER VI RIGHTS OF THE STATE 696. Where the deceased leaves no spouse or relatives within the degrees of succession, or where all the successors have renounced the succession, or where no successor is known or claims the succession, the State takes, by operation of law, the property of the succession situated in Québec. Any testamentary provision which would defeat this right without otherwise providing for the devolution of the property is without effect.
### Chunk 770

1991, c. 64, a. 696; I. N. 20140501. 697. The State is not an heir, but is nonetheless seized of the property bequeathed, as is an heir, once all known successors have renounced the succession, or, where no successor is known or claims the succession, six months after the death. It is not liable for obligations of the deceased in excess of the value of the property it takes. 1991, c. 64, a. 697; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 698. Seisin of a succession which falls to the State is exercised by the Minister of Revenue.
### Chunk 771

No property of a succession may be mingled with the property of the State so long as it remains under the administration of the Minister of Revenue. 1991, c. 64, a. 698; 1997, c. 80, s. 46; 2005, c. 44, s. 54; I. N. 20140501. 699. Subject to the Unclaimed Property Act (chapter B5. 1) and without any other formality, the Minister of Revenue acts as liquidator of the succession. He is bound to make an inventory and give notice of the seisin of the State in the Gazette officielle du Québec; he shall also cause the notice to be published in a newspaper circulated in the locality where the deceased was domiciled.
### Chunk 772

1991, c. 64, a. 699; 2005, c. 44, s. 54; 2011, c. 10, s. 63. 700. At the end of the liquidation, the Minister of Revenue renders an account to the Minister of Finance. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 180 of 556 ### Page 181 The Minister of Revenue gives and publishes a notice of the end of the liquidation in the same manner as for a notice of seisin of the State. He indicates in the notice the residue of the succession and the time granted to successors to assert their rights of heirship.
### Chunk 773

1991, c. 64, a. 700; 2005, c. 44, s. 54. 701. The Minister of Revenue, upon rendering account, transfers to the Minister of Finance the amounts constituting the residue of the succession, which then become the property of the State. Heirs who establish their quality may, however, within 10 years from the opening of the succession or from the day their right arises, recover those amounts from the Minister of Revenue with interest capitalized daily and calculated from the time the amounts were transferred to the Minister of Finance, at the rate set under the second paragraph of section 28 of the Tax Administration Act (chapter A6.

002). 1991, c. 64, a. 701; 1997, c. 80, s. 47; 2005, c. 44, s. 54; 2011, c. 10, s. 64. 702. An heir who claims the succession before the end of the liquidation takes it in its actual condition, subject to his right to claim damages if the legal formalities have not been observed. 1991, c. 64, a. 702; 1997, c. 80, s. 48; I. N. 20151101. TITLE FOUR WILLS CHAPTER I THE NATURE OF WILLS 703. Every person having the required capacity may, by will, provide otherwise than as by law for the devolution upon his death of the whole or part of his property.
### Chunk 775

1991, c. 64, a. 703. 704. A will is a unilateral and revocable juridical act drawn up in one of the forms provided for by law, by which the testator disposes by liberality of all or part of his property, to take effect only after his death. In no case may a will be made jointly by two or more persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 704. 705. The act is a will even if it contains only provisions regarding the liquidation of the succession, the revocation of previous testamentary provisions or the exclusion of an heir.
### Chunk 776

1991, c. 64, a. 705; I. N. 20151101. 706. No person may, even in a marriage or civil union contract, except within the limits provided in article 1841, renounce his or her right to make a will, to dispose of his or her property in contemplation of death or to revoke the testamentary provisions he or she has made. 1991, c. 64, a. 706; 2002, c. 6, s. 40; I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER II THE CAPACITY REQUIRED TO MAKE A WILL 707. The capacity of the testator is considered relatively to the time he made his will.

1991, c. 64, a. 707. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 181 of 556 ### Page 182 708. A minor may not dispose of any part of his property by will, except property of little value. 1991, c. 64, a. 708; 2016, c. 4, s. 95. 709. A will made by a person of full age after he has been placed under tutorship or after a protection mandate has been homologated for him may be confirmed by the court if the nature of its provisions and the circumstances in which it was drawn up allow it.
### Chunk 778

1991, c. 64, a. 709; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 11, s. 65. 710. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 710; 2020, c. 11, s. 66. 711. A tutor or mandatary may not make a will on behalf of the person whom he represents, either alone or jointly with that person. 1991, c. 64, a. 711; 2020, c. 11, s. 67. CHAPTER III FORMS OF WILLS DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS 712. The only forms of will that may be made are the notarial will, the holograph will and the will made in the presence of witnesses.
### Chunk 779

1991, c. 64, a. 712. 713. The formalities governing the various kinds of wills shall be observed, on pain of nullity. However, if a will made in one form does not meet the requirements of that form of will, it is valid as a will made in another form if it meets the requirements for validity of that other form. 1991, c. 64, a. 713; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 714. A holograph will or a will made in the presence of witnesses that does not fully meet the requirements of that form is valid nevertheless if it meets the essential requirements thereof and if it unquestionably and unequivocally contains the last wishes of the deceased.
### Chunk 780

1991, c. 64, a. 714; I. N. 20140501. 715. No one may cause the validity of his will to be subject to any formality not required by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 715; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II NOTARIAL WILLS 716. A notarial will is executed by a notary, en minute, in the presence of a witness or, in certain cases, two witnesses. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 182 of 556 ### Page 183 The date and place of the making of the will shall be noted on the will.
### Chunk 781

1991, c. 64, a. 716; I. N. 20140501. 717. A notarial will is read by the notary to the testator alone or, if the testator chooses, in the presence of a witness. Once the reading is done, the testator shall declare in the presence of the witness that the act read contains the expression of his last wishes. The will is then signed by the testator, the witness or witnesses and the notary, in each other’s presence. 1991, c. 64, a. 717; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 782

718. The formalities governing notarial wills are presumed to have been observed even when this is not expressly stated, subject to the laws governing the notarial profession. However, if formalities particular to certain wills apply, the act must mention the reason for their observance. 1991, c. 64, a. 718; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 719. The notarial will of a testator who cannot sign contains a declaration by him to that effect. This declaration also is read by the notary to the testator in the presence of two witnesses, and it compensates for the absence of the signature of the testator.
### Chunk 783

1991, c. 64, a. 719. 720. The notarial will of a blind person is read by the notary to the testator in the presence of two witnesses. In the will, the notary declares that he has read the will in the presence of the witnesses, and this declaration also is read. 1991, c. 64, a. 720. 721. The notarial will of a deaf person is read by the testator himself in the presence of the notary alone or, if he chooses, of the notary and a witness. If the testator is able to do so, he reads the will aloud.
### Chunk 784

In the will, the testator declares that he has read it in the presence of the notary and, where such is the case, the witness. If the testator is unable to speak, the declaration is read to him by the notary in the presence of the witness; if he is able to speak, it is read aloud by the testator himself, in the presence of the notary and the witness. 1991, c. 64, a. 721; 2013, c. 27, s. 24. 722. A person unable to express himself aloud who wishes to make a notarial will conveys his wishes to the notary in writing.
### Chunk 785

1991, c. 64, a. 722. 722. 1. A deaf person who, being unable to speak, read or write, cannot avail himself of the other provisions of this section may make a notarial will, provided he conveys his wishes to the notary through a signlanguage interpreter. The testator, in the presence of the notary and a witness, declares, through the same means, that the document translated to him by the interpreter is his will. The interpreter is chosen by the testator from among interpreters qualified to exercise their functions before the courts and may in no case be the spouse of the testator or related to the testator in either the direct CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 183 of 556 ### Page 184 or the collateral line up to and including the third degree, or be connected to that extent by marriage or a civil union to the testator.
### Chunk 786

The interpreter must first swear in writing, before the notary, the testator and the witness, to carry out his functions with impartiality and accuracy and not to disclose any information related to his mandate. The original of the oath is attached to the will. 2013, c. 27, s. 25; 2016, c. 4, s. 96. 723. In no case may a notarial will be executed by a notary who is the spouse of the testator, is related to the testator in either the direct or the collateral line up to and including the third degree, or is connected to that extent by marriage or a civil union to the testator.
### Chunk 787

1991, c. 64, a. 723; 2002, c. 6, s. 235; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 97. 724. The notary before whom a will is executed may be designated in the will as the liquidator, provided he fulfils that office gratuitously. 1991, c. 64, a. 724; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 725. A witness called upon to be present at the making of a notarial will shall be named and described in the will. Any person of full age may witness a notarial will, except an employee of the officiating notary who is not himself a notary.
### Chunk 788

1991, c. 64, a. 725; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III HOLOGRAPH WILLS 726. A holograph will shall be written entirely by the testator and signed by him, without the use of technical means. It is subject to no other formal requirement. 1991, c. 64, a. 726; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 98. DIVISION IV WILLS MADE IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES 727. A will made in the presence of witnesses is written by the testator or by a third person. The testator then declares in the presence of two witnesses of full age that the document he is presenting is his will.
### Chunk 789

He need not divulge its contents. He signs it at the end or, if he has already signed it, acknowledges his signature; he may also cause a third person to sign it for him in his presence and according to his instructions. The witnesses sign the will forthwith in the presence of the testator. 1991, c. 64, a. 727; I. N. 20140501. 728. Where the will is written by a third person or by technical means, the testator and the witnesses initial or sign each page of the act which does not bear their signature.
### Chunk 790

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 184 of 556 ### Page 185 The absence of initials or a signature on each page does not prevent a will made before a notary that is not valid as a notarial will from being valid as a will made in the presence of witnesses, if the other formalities are observed. 1991, c. 64, a. 728; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 99. 729. A person who is unable to read may make a will in the presence of witnesses, provided the will is read to the testator by one of the witnesses in the presence of the other.
### Chunk 791

The testator, in the presence of the same witnesses, declares that the document read is his will and signs it at the end or causes a third person to sign it for him in his presence and according to his instructions. The witnesses sign the will forthwith in the presence of the testator. 1991, c. 64, a. 729; 2013, c. 27, s. 26; I. N. 20140501. 730. A person who is unable to speak but able to write may make a will in the presence of witnesses, provided he indicates in writing, otherwise than by technical means, in the presence of the witnesses, that the document he is presenting is his will.
### Chunk 792

1991, c. 64, a. 730; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 100. 730. 1. A deaf person who, being unable to speak, read or write, cannot avail himself of the other provisions of this section may make a will in the presence of witnesses, provided he conveys his wishes to the drafter through a signlanguage interpreter. The testator, in the presence of the witnesses, declares, through the same means, that the document translated to him by the interpreter is his will. Where possible, the testator affixes his signature or a personal mark at the end of the will.
### Chunk 793

Otherwise, the testator has a third person sign for him, in his presence and in accordance with his instructions. The witnesses then sign the will immediately in the presence of the testator. The interpreter is chosen by the testator from among interpreters qualified to exercise their functions before the courts and may in no case be the spouse of the testator or be related to the testator in either the direct or the collateral line up to and including the third degree, or be connected to that extent by marriage or a civil union to the testator.
### Chunk 794

The interpreter must first swear in writing, before the drafter, the testator and the witnesses, to carry out his functions with impartiality and accuracy and not to disclose any information related to his mandate. The original of the oath is attached to the will. 2013, c. 27, s. 27; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 101. CHAPTER IV TESTAMENTARY PROVISIONS AND LEGATEES I. N. 20151101. DIVISION I VARIOUS KINDS OF LEGACIES 731. Legacies are of three kinds: universal, by general title and by particular title.
### Chunk 795

1991, c. 64, a. 731. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 185 of 556 ### Page 186 732. A universal legacy entitles one or several persons to take the entire succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 732. 733. A legacy by general title entitles one or several persons to take (1) the ownership of an aliquot share of the succession; (2) a dismemberment of the right of ownership of the whole or of an aliquot share of the succession; (3) the ownership or a dismemberment of the right of ownership of the whole or of an aliquot share of all the immovable or movable property, private property, community property or acquests, or corporeal or incorporeal property.
### Chunk 796

1991, c. 64, a. 733; I. N. 20140501. 734. Any legacy which is neither a universal legacy nor a legacy by general title is a legacy by particular title. 1991, c. 64, a. 734. 735. The exception of particular items of property, whatever their number or value, does not affect the character of a universal legacy or of a legacy by general title. 1991, c. 64, a. 735; I. N. 20140501. 736. Property left by the testator for which he made no provision or for which the provisions are without effect remains in his intestate succession and devolves according to the rules governing legal devolution of successions.
### Chunk 797

1991, c. 64, a. 736; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 737. Testamentary provisions made in the form of an appointment of heir, a gift or a legacy, or in other terms indicating the intentions of the testator, take effect according to the rules provided in this Book with regard to universal legacies, legacies by general title or legacies by particular title. Sufficient expression by the testator of a different intention takes precedence over the rules referred to in the first paragraph and the meaning ascribed to certain terms.
### Chunk 798

1991, c. 64, a. 737; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II LEGATEES 738. A universal legatee or legatee by general title is an heir upon the opening of the succession, provided he accepts the legacy. 1991, c. 64, a. 738; I. N. 20140501. 739. A legatee by particular title who accepts the legacy is not an heir, but is nonetheless seized of the property bequeathed, as is an heir, by the death of the deceased or by the event which gives effect to the legacy. He is not liable for the debts of the deceased on the property of the legacy unless the other property of the succession is insufficient to pay the debts, in which case he is liable only up to the value of the property he takes.
### Chunk 799

1991, c. 64, a. 739; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 186 of 556 ### Page 187 740. In order to receive his legacy, a legatee by particular title is required to have the same qualities as are required to inherit. He may be unworthy to receive the legacy just as a person may be unworthy to inherit; like a successor, he may apply to the court to have an heir or a colegatee by particular title declared unworthy.
### Chunk 800

1991, c. 64, a. 740; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 741. Like a successor, a legatee by particular title has the right to deliberate and exercise his option with respect to the legacy made to him, with the same effects and according to the same rules. 1991, c. 64, a. 741; I. N. 20140501. 742. The provisions concerning the petition of inheritance and its effects on the transmission of the succession are also applicable, adapted as required, to a legatee by particular title.
### Chunk 801

In all other respects, the legatee by particular title is subject to the provisions of this Book concerning legatees. 1991, c. 64, a. 742; I. N. 20140501. 742. 1. A child born as a result of sexual assault is considered a descendant in the first degree of the person who committed the assault, despite the absence of a bond of filiation with regard to that person, for the execution of the person’s testamentary provisions or those of the person’s relatives, subject to the sufficient expression by the testator of a different intention.
### Chunk 802

Sexual assault may be proved, among other means, by the production of a judgment recognizing its existence. 2023, c. 13, s. 30. 742. 2. For the purposes of article 742. 1, if the sexual assault is proved, the court may order the analysis of a sample of a bodily substance so that the genetic profile of the person who committed the sexual assault may be established. The court determines conditions for the sampletaking and analysis that are as respectful as possible of the physical integrity of the person concerned or of the body of the deceased.
### Chunk 803

These conditions include the nature and the date and place of the sampletaking, the identity of the expert charged with taking and analyzing the sample, the use of any sample taken and the confidentiality of the analysis results. The court may draw a negative presumption from an unjustified refusal to submit to the analysis ordered by the court. 2023, c. 13, s. 30. DIVISION III THE EFFECT OF LEGACIES 743. Fruits and revenues from the property bequeathed accrue to the legatee from the opening of the succession or the time when the provision takes effect in his favour.
### Chunk 804

1991, c. 64, a. 743; I. N. 20151101. 744. Bequeathed property is delivered, with its accessories, in the condition in which it was when the testator died. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 187 of 556 ### Page 188 This rule also applies to the rights attached to bequeathed securities, if they have not yet been exercised. 1991, c. 64, a. 744; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 102. 745. Where immovable property is bequeathed, any accessory or annexed immovable property acquired by the testator after signing the will is presumed to be included in the legacy, provided the property forms a whole with the immovable bequeathed.
### Chunk 805

1991, c. 64, a. 745; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 103. 746. The legacy of an enterprise is presumed to include the operations acquired or created after the signing of the will which, at the time of death, form an economic unit with the bequeathed enterprise. 1991, c. 64, a. 746; I. N. 20140501. 747. Where the payment of a legacy is subject to a term, the legatee nevertheless has an acquired right from the death of the testator which is transmissible to his own heirs or legatees by particular title.
### Chunk 806

The right of the legatee to a legacy made under a condition is also transmissible unless the condition is of a purely personal nature. 1991, c. 64, a. 747. 748. A legacy to a creditor is not presumed to have been made as compensation for his claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 748. 749. Where, in testate successions, the legacy is made to all the descendants or collaterals of the testator who would have been called to his succession had he died intestate, representation takes place in the same manner and in favour of the same persons as in intestate successions, unless it is excluded by the testator, expressly or by the effect of the provisions of the will.
### Chunk 807

There is no representation in the matter of legacies by particular title, however, unless the testator has so provided. 1991, c. 64, a. 749; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION IV LAPSE AND NULLITY OF LEGACIES 750. A legacy lapses when the legatee does not survive the testator, except where there may be representation. A legacy also lapses where the legatee refuses it, is unworthy to receive it or dies before the fulfilment of the suspensive condition attached to it, if the condition is of a purely personal nature.
### Chunk 808

1991, c. 64, a. 750; I. N. 20140501. 751. A legacy also lapses if the bequeathed property perished totally during the lifetime of the testator or before the opening of a legacy made under a suspensive condition. If the loss of the property occurs at the death of the testator, at the opening of the legacy or subsequently, the insurance indemnity is substituted for the property that perished. 1991, c. 64, a. 751; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 188 of 556 ### Page 189 752.
### Chunk 809

Where a legacy charged with another legacy lapses from a cause depending on the legatee, the legacy imposed as a charge also lapses, unless the heir or legatee called to take what was the object of the lapsed legacy is able to execute the charge. 1991, c. 64, a. 752. 753. A legacy made to the liquidator as remuneration lapses if he does not accept the office. This is also the case where a legacy is made to remunerate the person appointed by the testator as tutor to a minor child or designated by him to act as the administrator of the property of others.
### Chunk 810

1991, c. 64, a. 753. 754. A remunerative legacy is resolved where the liquidator, tutor or another administrator of the property of others designated by the testator ceases to hold that office; he has in this case a right to remuneration proportionate to the value of the legacy and the time for which he held the office. 1991, c. 64, a. 754; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 104. 755. Accretion takes place in favour of the legatees by particular title where property is bequeathed to them jointly and a lapse occurs with regard to one of them.
### Chunk 811

1991, c. 64, a. 755. 756. A legacy by particular title is presumed to be made jointly if it is made by one and the same provision and if the testator has not allotted the share of each colegatee in the bequeathed property or has allotted the colegatees equal aliquot shares. It is also presumed to be made jointly when the entire property is bequeathed by the same act to several persons separately. 1991, c. 64, a. 756; I. N. 20151101. 757. A condition that is impossible or that is contrary to public order is deemed unwritten.
### Chunk 812

Thus, a clause limiting the rights of a surviving spouse in the event of a remarriage or new civil union is deemed unwritten. 1991, c. 64, a. 757; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; 2002, c. 6, s. 41. 758. A penal clause intended to prevent an heir or a legatee by particular title from contesting the validity of the will or any part of it is deemed unwritten. A disinheritance taking the form of a penal clause intended for the same purpose is also deemed unwritten. 1991, c. 64, a. 758; I.
### Chunk 813

N. 20140501. 759. A legacy made to the notary who executes a will or to the spouse of the notary or to a relative in the first degree of the notary is without effect; this does not affect the other provisions of the will. 1991, c. 64, a. 759; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 760. A legacy made to a witness, even a supernumerary, is without effect, but this does not affect the other provisions of the will. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 189 of 556 ### Page 190 The same is true for that part of the legacy made to the liquidator or to another administrator of property of others designated in the will which exceeds his remuneration, if he acts as a witness.
### Chunk 814

1991, c. 64, a. 760; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 761. A legacy made to the owner, a director or an employee of a health or social services establishment who is neither the spouse nor a close relative of the testator is without effect if it was made while the testator was receiving care or services at the establishment. A legacy made to a member of a foster family while the testator was residing with that family is also without effect. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 815

761; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. 762. A legacy of property of another is without effect, unless it appears that the intention of the testator was to oblige the heir to obtain the bequeathed property for the legatee by particular title. 1991, c. 64, a. 762; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. CHAPTER V REVOCATION OF WILLS AND LEGACIES 763. Revocation of a will or of a legacy is express or tacit. 1991, c. 64, a. 763. 764. A legacy made to the spouse before a divorce or the dissolution of a civil union is revoked unless the testator manifested, by means of testamentary provisions, the intention of benefitting the spouse despite that possibility.
### Chunk 816

Revocation of the legacy entails revocation of the designation of the spouse as liquidator of the succession. The same rules apply if the marriage or civil union is declared null during the lifetime of the spouses. 1991, c. 64, a. 764; 2002, c. 6, s. 42; I. N. 20140501. 765. Express revocation is made by a subsequent will explicitly declaring the change of intention. A revocation that does not specifically refer to the revoked act is nonetheless express. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 817

765. 766. A will that revokes another will may be made in a different form from that of the revoked will. 1991, c. 64, a. 766. 767. The destruction, tearing or erasure of a holograph will or of a will made in the presence of witnesses entails revocation if it is established that this was done deliberately by the testator or on his instructions. Similarly, the erasure of any provision of a will entails revocation of the legacy made by that provision. Revocation is entailed also where the testator was aware of the destruction or loss of the will and could have replaced it.
### Chunk 818

1991, c. 64, a. 767; I. N. 20140501. 768. A subsequent testamentary provision similarly entails tacit revocation of a previous provision to the extent that they are inconsistent. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 190 of 556 ### Page 191 The revocation retains its full effect even if the subsequent provision lapses. 1991, c. 64, a. 768; I. N. 20140501. 769. Alienation of bequeathed property, even when forced or made under a resolutive condition or by exchange, also entails revocation with regard to everything that has been alienated, unless the testator provided otherwise.
### Chunk 819

Revocation subsists even if the alienated property has returned into the patrimony of the testator, unless a contrary intention is proved. If the forced alienation of the bequeathed property is annulled, it does not entail revocation. 1991, c. 64, a. 769. 770. Revocation of a previous express or tacit revocation does not revive the original provision, unless the testator manifested a contrary intention or unless such intention is apparent from the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 820

770; I. N. 20140501. 771. If, owing to circumstances unforeseeable at the time of the acceptance of the legacy, the execution of a charge becomes impossible or too burdensome for the heir or the legatee by particular title, the court, after hearing the interested persons, may revoke it or change it, taking account of the value of the legacy, the intention of the testator and the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 771. CHAPTER VI PROOF AND PROBATE OF WILLS 772. A holograph will or a will made in the presence of witnesses is probated, on the application of any interested person, in the manner prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 821

01). The known heirs and successors shall be summoned to the probate of the will unless an exemption is granted by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 772; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 773. No person having acknowledged a will may thereafter contest its validity, although he may apply to have the will probated. In the case of contestation of a will which has been probated, the burden is on the person availing himself of the will to prove its origin and regularity. 1991, c.
### Chunk 822

64, a. 773; I. N. 20140501. 774. A will that is not produced may not be probated; it must be reconstituted upon an action in which the heirs, the other successors and the legatees by particular title have been summoned, and the proof of its contents, origin and regularity must be conclusive and unequivocal. 1991, c. 64, a. 774; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 775. Proof by testimony of a will that cannot be produced is admissible if the will has been lost or destroyed, or is in the possession of a third person, without the collusion of the person who wishes to avail himself of the will.
### Chunk 823

1991, c. 64, a. 775. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 191 of 556 ### Page 192 TITLE FIVE LIQUIDATION OF SUCCESSIONS CHAPTER I OBJECT OF LIQUIDATION AND SEPARATION OF PATRIMONIES 776. The liquidation of an intestate or testate succession consists in identifying and calling in the successors, determining the content of the succession, recovering the claims, paying the debts of the succession, whether these be debts of the deceased, charges on the succession or debts of support, paying the legacies by particular title, rendering an account and delivering the property.
### Chunk 824

1991, c. 64, a. 776. 777. The liquidator exercises, from the opening of the succession and for the time necessary for liquidation, the seisin of the heirs and the legatees by particular title. The liquidator may even claim the property against the heirs and the legatees by particular title. The designation or replacement of the liquidator of the succession is published in the register of personal and movable real rights and, where applicable, in the land register. Registration of the act of designation or replacement is obtained by presenting a notice which refers to the act of designation or replacement, identifies the deceased and the liquidator and contains the description of the immovables concerned, if any.
### Chunk 825

1991, c. 64, a. 777; 1998, c. 51, s. 26; 1999, c. 49, s. 1; 2016, c. 4, s. 105. 778. The testator may modify the seisin, powers and obligations of the liquidator and provide in any other manner for the liquidation of his succession or the execution of his will. However, a clause that would in effect restrict the powers or obligations of the liquidator in such a manner as to prevent an act necessary for liquidation or to exempt him from making an inventory is deemed unwritten.
### Chunk 826

1991, c. 64, a. 778; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. 779. Where the succession is manifestly solvent, the heirs may, by mutual agreement, liquidate it without following the prescribed rules for liquidation. As a result of this decision, they are liable for payment of the debts of the succession from their own patrimony, even where the debts exceed the value of the property they take. 1991, c. 64, a. 779; I. N. 20140501. 780. The patrimony of the deceased is separate from that of the heir by operation of law until the succession has been liquidated.
### Chunk 827

The separation has effect with regard to both the creditors of the succession and the creditors of the heir or of the legatee by particular title. 1991, c. 64, a. 780; I. N. 20140501. 781. The property of the succession is used to pay the creditors of the succession and to pay the legatees by particular title, in preference to any creditor of the heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 781. 782. The property of the heir is used to pay the debts of the succession only in the case where the heir is liable for debts of greater value than the property he takes and the property of the succession is insufficient.
### Chunk 828

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 192 of 556 ### Page 193 In that case, payment of the creditor of the succession is made only after payment of the creditor of each heir whose claim arose before the opening of the succession. However, a creditor of the heir whose claim arose after the opening of the succession is paid concurrently with the unpaid creditors of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 782; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II LIQUIDATOR OF THE SUCCESSION DIVISION I DESIGNATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LIQUIDATOR 783.
### Chunk 829

Any person fully capable of exercising his civil rights may hold the office of liquidator. A legal person authorized by law to administer the property of others may hold the office of liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 783. 784. No one is bound to accept the office of liquidator of a succession unless he is the sole heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 784; I. N. 20151101. 785. The office of liquidator devolves by operation of law to the heirs unless otherwise provided by a testamentary provision; the majority of the heirs may designate the liquidator and provide the mode of his replacement.
### Chunk 830

1991, c. 64, a. 785; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 106. 785. 1. If the sole heir is a minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate, unless otherwise provided by a testamentary provision, his representative designates a liquidator other than himself and may provide the mode of the liquidator’s replacement. The same rule applies if such an heir and his representative are the two sole heirs. 2020, c. 11, s. 68. 786. A testator may designate one or several liquidators; he may also provide the mode of their replacement.
### Chunk 831

A person designated by a testator to liquidate the succession or execute his will has the quality of liquidator whether he was designated as administrator of the succession, testamentary executor or otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 786. 787. Persons holding the office of liquidator together shall act in concert, unless exempted therefrom by the will or, in the absence of a testamentary provision, by the heirs. If one of the liquidators is prevented from acting, the others may perform alone acts of a conservatory nature and acts requiring dispatch.
### Chunk 832

1991, c. 64, a. 787; I. N. 20140501. 788. The court may, on the application of an interested person, designate or replace a liquidator failing agreement among the heirs or if it is impossible to appoint or replace the liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 788. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 193 of 556 ### Page 194 789. The liquidator is entitled to the reimbursement of the expenses incurred in fulfilling his office. He is entitled to remuneration if he is not an heir; if he is an heir, he may be remunerated if the will so provides or the heirs so agree.
### Chunk 833

If the remuneration was not fixed by the testator, it is fixed by the heirs or, in case of disagreement among the interested persons, by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 789. 790. The liquidator is not bound to take out insurance or to furnish other security guaranteeing the performance of his obligations, unless the testator or the majority of the heirs require it or the court orders it on the application of any interested person who establishes the need for such a measure. If a liquidator required to furnish security fails or refuses to do so, he forfeits his office, unless the court relieves him of his default.
### Chunk 834

1991, c. 64, a. 790; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 107. 791. Any interested person may apply to the court for the replacement of a liquidator who is unable to assume the responsibilities of his office, who neglects his duties or who does not fulfil his obligations. During the proceedings, the liquidator continues to hold office unless the court decides to designate a provisional liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 791; I. N. 20140501. 792. Where the liquidator is not designated, delays to accept or decline the office or is to be replaced, any interested person may apply to the court to have seals affixed, an inventory made, a provisional liquidator appointed or any other order rendered which is necessary to preserve his rights.
### Chunk 835

These measures benefit all the interested persons but create no preference among them. The costs of inventory and seals are charged to the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 792; I. N. 20140501. 793. Acts performed by a person who, in good faith, believed he was liquidator of the succession are valid and may be set up against anyone. 1991, c. 64, a. 793; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II INVENTORY OF THE PROPERTY 794. The liquidator is bound to make an inventory, in the manner prescribed in the Title on Administration of the Property of Others.
### Chunk 836

1991, c. 64, a. 794. 795. Closure of the inventory is published in the register of personal and movable real rights by registration of a notice identifying the deceased and indicating the place where the inventory may be consulted by interested persons. The notice is also published in a newspaper circulated in the locality where the deceased had his last known address. 1991, c. 64, a. 795.

The liquidator informs the heirs, the successors who have not yet exercised their option, the legatees by particular title and the known creditors of the registration of the notice of closure and of the place where the inventory may be consulted, and transmits a copy of the inventory to them if that can easily be done. 1991, c. 64, a. 796. 797. The creditors of the succession, the heirs, the successors and the legatees by particular title may contest the inventory or any item in it; they may also agree to a revision of the inventory or request a new inventory.
### Chunk 838

1991, c. 64, a. 797; I. N. 20140501. 798. Where an inventory has already been made by an heir or another interested person, the liquidator shall verify it. He shall also ascertain that the notice of closure has been registered and that everyone who should have been informed has been informed. 1991, c. 64, a. 798; I. N. 20140501. 799. The liquidator may be exempted from making an inventory, but only with the consent of all the heirs and successors. If they give their consent, the heirs, and the successors having by that fact become heirs, are liable for the debts of the succession that exceed the value of the property they take.
### Chunk 839

1991, c. 64, a. 799; I. N. 20140501. 800. Where the heirs, knowing that the liquidator refuses or neglects to make the inventory, themselves neglect, within 60 days following the expiry of the sixmonth period for deliberation, to proceed with the inventory or to apply to the court to have the liquidator replaced or for an order to have him proceed with the inventory, they are liable for the debts of the succession that exceed the value of the property they take. 1991, c. 64, a. 800; I.
### Chunk 840

N. 20140501. 801. Heirs who, before the inventory, mingle the property of the succession with their personal property, unless the property was already mingled before the death, such as in the case of cohabitation, are likewise liable for the debts of the succession that exceed the value of the property they take. If the mingling is done after the inventory but before the end of the liquidation, they are personally liable for the debts up to the value of the mingled property. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 841

801; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III FUNCTIONS OF THE LIQUIDATOR 802. The liquidator acts with respect to the property of the succession as an administrator of the property of others charged with simple administration. 1991, c. 64, a. 802; I. N. 20140501. 803. The liquidator shall make a search to ascertain whether the deceased made a will. If the deceased made a will, the liquidator causes the will to be probated and takes all the necessary steps for its execution. 1991, c.
### Chunk 842

64, a. 803. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 195 of 556 ### Page 196 804. The liquidator administers the succession. He realizes the property of the succession to the extent necessary to pay the debts and the legacies by particular title. To do this, he may alienate, alone, movable property that is perishable, likely to depreciate rapidly or expensive to preserve. He may also alienate the other property of the succession with the consent of the heirs or, failing that, the authorization of the court.
### Chunk 843

1991, c. 64, a. 804; I. N. 20140501. 805. A liquidator who has an action to bring against the succession gives notice thereof to the Minister of Revenue. The latter acts by virtue of his office as liquidator ad hoc, unless the heirs or the court designate another person. 1991, c. 64, a. 805; 2005, c. 44, s. 54. 806. If the liquidation takes longer than one year, the liquidator shall, at the end of the first year, and at least once a year thereafter, render an annual account of management to the heirs, creditors and legatees by particular title who have not been paid.
### Chunk 844

1991, c. 64, a. 806. 807. Where the succession is manifestly solvent, the liquidator, after ascertaining that all the creditors and legatees by particular title can be paid, may pay advances to the creditors of support and to the heirs and legatees by particular title of sums of money. The advances are imputed to the shares of those who receive them. 1991, c. 64, a. 807; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER III PAYMENT OF DEBTS AND OF LEGACIES BY PARTICULAR TITLE DIVISION I PAYMENTS BY THE LIQUIDATOR 808.
### Chunk 845

If the property of the succession is sufficient to pay all the creditors and all the legatees by particular title and if provision is made to pay the claims that are the subject of proceedings, the liquidator pays the known creditors and known legatees by particular title as and when they present themselves. The liquidator pays the ordinary public utility bills and pays the outstanding debts as and when they become due or according to the agreed terms and conditions. 1991, c. 64, a. 808.
### Chunk 846

809. The liquidator pays, in the same manner as any other debt of the succession, the compensatory allowance to the surviving spouse and any other claim resulting from the liquidation of the patrimonial rights of the married or civil union spouses, as agreed between the heirs, the legatees by particular title and the spouse or, failing such agreement, as determined by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 809; 2002, c. 6, s. 43; I. N. 20140501. 810. Where the succession is not manifestly solvent, the liquidator may not pay the debts of the succession or the legacies by particular title until the expiry of 60 days from registration of the notice of closure of inventory or from the exemption from making an inventory.
### Chunk 847

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 196 of 556 ### Page 197 The liquidator may pay the ordinary public utility bills and the debts in urgent need of payment before the expiry of that time, however, if circumstances require it. 1991, c. 64, a. 810. 811. If the property of the succession is insufficient, the liquidator may not pay any debt or legacy by particular title before drawing up a full statement thereof, giving notice to the interested persons and obtaining homologation by the court of a payment proposal which contains a provision for a reserve, if appropriate, for the payment of any potential judgment.
### Chunk 848

1991, c. 64, a. 811; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 108. 812. Where the property of the succession is insufficient, the liquidator, in accordance with his payment proposal, first pays the prior or hypothecary creditors, according to their rank; next, he pays the other creditors, except with regard to their claims for support, and, if he is unable to repay them fully, he pays them in proportion to their claims. If property remains after the creditors have been paid, the liquidator pays the creditors of support, in proportion to their claims if he is unable to pay them fully, and he then pays the legatees by particular title.
### Chunk 849

1991, c. 64, a. 812; I. N. 20140501. 813. The liquidator may alienate property bequeathed as legacies by particular title or reduce the legacies by particular title if the other property of the succession is insufficient to pay all the debts. The alienation or reduction is effected in the order and in the proportions agreed by the legatees. Failing agreement, the liquidator first reduces the legacies not having preference under the will nor involving certain and determinate property, in proportion to their value.
### Chunk 850

Where the property is still insufficient, he alienates the subjects of legacies of certain and determinate property, then the subjects of legacies having preference, or reduces such legacies in proportion to their value. The legatees may always agree to another mode of settlement or be relieved by giving back their legacies or equivalent value. 1991, c. 64, a. 813; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 109. 814. If the property of the succession is insufficient to pay all the legatees by particular title, the liquidator, in accordance with his payment proposal, first pays those having preference under the will and then the legatees of certain and determinate property.
### Chunk 851

The other legatees then have their legacies reduced proportionately, and the remainder is partitioned among them in proportion to the value of each legacy. 1991, c. 64, a. 814; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 110. DIVISION II ACTION OF CREDITORS AND LEGATEES BY PARTICULAR TITLE 815. Known creditors and legatees by particular title who have been omitted in the payments made by the liquidator have, in addition to their action in liability against the liquidator, an action against the heirs who have received advances and against the legatees by particular title paid to their detriment.
### Chunk 852

Subsidiarily, the creditors also have an action against the other creditors in proportion to their claims, taking into account the causes of preference. 1991, c. 64, a. 815; I. N. 20140501. 816. Creditors and legatees by particular title who, remaining unknown, do not present themselves until after the payments have been regularly made have no action against the heirs who have received advances and CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 197 of 556 ### Page 198 against the legatees by particular title paid to their detriment unless they prove that they had a serious reason for not presenting themselves in due time.
### Chunk 853

In no case do they have an action if they present themselves after the expiry of three years from the discharge of the liquidator, or any preference over the personal creditors of the heirs or legatees. 1991, c. 64, a. 816. 817. Where the reserve provided for in a payment proposal is insufficient, the creditor has, for the payment of his share of the outstanding claim, an action against the heirs who have received advances and legatees by particular title up to the amount they received and, subsidiarily, an action against the other creditors, in proportion to their claims, taking into account the causes of preference.
### Chunk 854

1991, c. 64, a. 817; I. N. 20140501. 818. A hypothecary creditor who has an outstanding claim retains, in addition to his personal action, his hypothecary rights against the person who received the hypothecated property. 1991, c. 64, a. 818; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER IV END OF LIQUIDATION DIVISION I ACCOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATOR 819. Liquidation is complete when the known creditors and the known legatees by particular title have been paid or when payment of their claims and legacies is otherwise settled or assumed by heirs or legatees by particular title.
### Chunk 855

It is also complete when the assets are exhausted. It ends by the discharge of the liquidator. 1991, c. 64, a. 819; I. N. 20140501. 820. The object of the final account of the liquidator is to determine the net assets or the deficit of the succession. The final account indicates the debts and legacies left unpaid, those guaranteed by security or assumed by heirs or legatees by particular title and those whose payment is settled otherwise, specifying the mode of payment for each.
### Chunk 856

Where applicable, it establishes the reserves needed for the satisfaction of potential judgments. The liquidator shall append a proposal for partition to his account if that is required by the will or the majority of the heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 820; I. N. 20140501. 821. The liquidator, at any time and with the concurrence of all the heirs, may render an amicable account. The cost of rendering the account is borne by the succession. If an amicable account cannot be rendered, the account is rendered in court.
### Chunk 857

1991, c. 64, a. 821; 2016, c. 4, s. 111. 822. After acceptance of the final account, the liquidator is discharged of his administration and delivers the property to the heirs. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 198 of 556 ### Page 199 Closure of the account is published in the register of personal and movable real rights by registration of a notice identifying the deceased and indicating the place where the account may be consulted. 1991, c.
### Chunk 858

64, a. 822; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 112. DIVISION II OBLIGATIONS OF HEIRS AND LEGATEES BY PARTICULAR TITLE AFTER LIQUIDATION 823. The sole heir to a succession is liable, up to the value of the property he takes, for all the debts not paid by the liquidator. However, the creditors and legatees by particular title who do not present themselves until after the payments have been regularly made have no preference over the personal creditors of the heir. Where a succession devolves to several heirs, each of them is liable for the debts only in proportion to the share he receives as an heir, subject to the rules governing indivisible debts.
### Chunk 859

1991, c. 64, a. 823. 824. The legatee by general title of a usufruct is solely liable to the creditors for the debts left unpaid by the liquidator, even for the capital, proportionately to what he receives, and also for hypothecs charged on any property he has received. The relative contributions of the legatee by general title of the usufruct and of the bare owner to the debts are determined according to the rules prescribed in the Book on Property. 1991, c. 64, a. 824; I. N.
### Chunk 860

20151101. 825. The legatee by general title of a usufruct of the entire succession is, without recourse against the bare owner, liable for payment of any annuities or support established by the testator. 1991, c. 64, a. 825. 826. The heirs are liable, as in the case of payment of the debts, for payment of the legacies by particular title left unpaid by the liquidator, but never for more than the value of the property they take. If a legacy is imposed on a specific heir, however, the action of the legatee by particular title does not lie against the others.
### Chunk 861

1991, c. 64, a. 826. 827. The legatees by particular title are liable for payment of the debts and legacies left unpaid by the liquidator only where the property devolving to the heirs is insufficient. Where a legacy by particular title is made jointly to several legatees, each of them is liable for the debts and legacies only in proportion to his share in the bequeathed property, subject to the rules on indivisible debts. 1991, c. 64, a. 827; I. N. 20140501. 828. When a legacy by particular title includes a universality of assets and liabilities, the legatee is solely liable for payment of the debts connected with the universality, subject to the subsidiary action of the creditors against the heirs and the other legatees by particular title where the property of the universality is insufficient.
### Chunk 862

1991, c. 64, a. 828. 829. An heir or a legatee by particular title who has paid part of the debts and legacies in excess of his share has an action against his coheirs or colegatees for the reimbursement of the excess over his share. His CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 199 of 556 ### Page 200 action lies, however, only for the share that each of them ought to have paid individually, even if he is subrogated to the rights of the person who was paid.
### Chunk 863

1991, c. 64, a. 829. 830. If one of the coheirs or colegatees is insolvent, his share in the payment of the debts or in the reduction of the legacies is divided among his coheirs or colegatees in proportion to their respective shares, unless one of the coheirs or colegatees agrees to bear the entire amount. 1991, c. 64, a. 830. 831. A usufruct established on bequeathed property is borne without recourse by the legatee of the bare ownership. Similarly, a servitude is borne without recourse by the legatee of the property charged with it.
### Chunk 864

1991, c. 64, a. 831. 832. Where the rights of action of the unpaid creditors or legatees by particular title are exercised before partition, account shall be taken, in the composition of the shares, of the actions of the heirs or legatees against their coheirs or colegatees for the amounts they paid in excess of their shares. Where the rights of action of the unpaid creditors or legatees are exercised after partition, those of the heirs or legatees who paid more than their share are exercised, where such is the case, according to the rules applicable to the warranty of copartitioners, unless the act of partition stipulates otherwise.
### Chunk 865

1991, c. 64, a. 832. 833. The testator may change the manner and proportion in which the law holds his heirs and legatees by particular title liable for payment of the debts and imposes reduction of the legacies on them. The changes may not be set up against the creditors; they have effect only between the heirs and the legatees by particular title. 1991, c. 64, a. 833; I. N. 20140501. 834. An heir having assumed payment of the debts of the succession beyond the value of the property he takes or being liable for them may be held liable on his personal property for his share of the debts left unpaid.
### Chunk 866

1991, c. 64, a. 834. 835. An heir having assumed payment of the debts of the succession or being liable for them under the rules of this Title may, if he was in good faith, apply to the court to have his obligation reduced or his liability limited to the value of the property he has taken if new circumstances substantially change the extent of his obligation, including, but not limited to, his discovery of new facts, or the coming forward of a creditor of whose existence he could not have been aware when he assumed the obligation.
### Chunk 867

1991, c. 64, a. 835; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 200 of 556 ### Page 201 TITLE SIX PARTITION OF SUCCESSIONS CHAPTER I RIGHT TO PARTITION 836. Partition may not take place or be applied for before the liquidation is terminated. 1991, c. 64, a. 836. 837. The testator, for a serious and legitimate reason, may order partition wholly or partly deferred for a limited time. He may also order it deferred if, to carry out his intentions fully, it is necessary that the powers and obligations of the liquidator continue to be held under another title.
### Chunk 868

1991, c. 64, a. 837. 838. If all the heirs agree, partition is made in accordance with the proposal appended to the final account of the liquidator or is made as they see best. If the heirs disagree, partition may not take place except under the conditions set out in Chapter II and in the forms required by the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). 1991, c. 64, a. 838; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 113. 839. Notwithstanding an application for partition, indivision may be maintained in respect of a family enterprise that had been operated by the deceased, or of the shares or other securities connected with the enterprise where the deceased was the principal partner or shareholder.
### Chunk 869

1991, c. 64, a. 839; I. N. 20140501. 840. Indivision may also be maintained in respect of the family residence or of movable property serving for the use of the household, even where a right of ownership, usufruct or use is granted to the surviving married or civil union spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 840; 2002, c. 6, s. 44; I. N. 20140501. 841. An heir who before the death actively participated in the operation of the enterprise or lived in the family residence may apply to the court for the maintenance of the indivision.
### Chunk 870

1991, c. 64, a. 841; I. N. 20140501. 842. When deciding an application for the maintenance of indivision, the court takes into account the testamentary provisions, as well as the interests involved and the means of livelihood which the family and the heirs derive from the undivided property; in all cases, the agreements among the partners or shareholders to which the deceased was a party are respected. 1991, c. 64, a. 842; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 114. 843. On the application of an heir, the court may, to avoid a loss, stay the immediate partition of the whole or part of the property and maintain indivision in respect of it.
### Chunk 871

1991, c. 64, a. 843; I. N. 20140501. 844. Maintenance of indivision takes place upon the conditions fixed by the court but may not be granted for a duration of more than five years except with the agreement of all the interested persons. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 201 of 556 ### Page 202 It may be renewed until the death of the married or civil union spouse or until the majority of the youngest child of the deceased. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 872

844; 2002, c. 6, s. 45; I. N. 20140501. 845. The court may order partition where the causes that justified the maintenance of indivision have ceased or where indivision has become intolerable or presents great risks for the heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 845; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 115. 846. If an application for the maintenance of indivision contemplates a particular item of property or a group of properties, nothing prevents proceeding with the partition of the residue of the property of the succession.
### Chunk 873

Furthermore, the heirs may always satisfy an heir who objects to the maintenance of indivision by paying his share themselves or granting him, after evaluation, other property of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 846; I. N. 20140501. 847. A person entitled only to enjoyment of a share of the undivided property may only participate in a provisional partition. 1991, c. 64, a. 847; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 116. 848. Every heir may exclude from the partition a person who is not an heir but to whom another heir transferred his right in the succession, by paying him the value of the right as at the time of the withdrawal and his disbursements for costs related to the transfer.
### Chunk 874

1991, c. 64, a. 848; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II MODES OF PARTITION DIVISION I COMPOSITION OF SHARES 849. Partition may include all or only part of the undivided property. Partition of an immovable is deemed to have been carried out even if parts remain which are common and indivisible or which are intended to remain undivided. 1991, c. 64, a. 849. 850. If the undivided shares are equal, as many shares are composed as there are heirs or partitioning roots. If the undivided shares are unequal, as many shares are composed as necessary to allow a drawing of lots.
### Chunk 875

1991, c. 64, a. 850. 851. In composing the shares, account shall be taken of the testamentary provisions, particularly those charging certain heirs with payment of debts or legacies, as well as the rights of action the heirs have against each other for the amounts they paid in excess of their shares; account shall also be taken of the rights of the surviving married or civil union spouse, the applications for allotment by preference, the objections and, where such is the case, the reserve funds for satisfying potential judgments.
### Chunk 876

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 202 of 556 ### Page 203 Consideration may also be given to, among other things, the fiscal consequences of the allotments, the intention shown by certain heirs to assume certain debts or the convenience of the mode of allotment. 1991, c. 64, a. 851; 2002, c. 6, s. 46; I. N. 20140501. 852. In composing the shares, immovables should not be parcelled and enterprises should not be divided up. Insofar as the dividing up of immovables and enterprises can be avoided, each share shall, as far as possible, be composed of movable or immovable property and rights or claims of equivalent value.
### Chunk 877

Any inequality in the value of the shares is compensated by the payment of an equalizing sum. 1991, c. 64, a. 852; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 853. Heirs in indivision who make an amicable partition compose the shares as they see fit and decide, by mutual agreement, on their allotment or on a drawing of lots for them. If they consider it necessary to sell all or some of the property to be partitioned, they also set, by mutual agreement, the terms and conditions of sale. 1991, c.
### Chunk 878

64, a. 853; I. N. 20140501. 854. If the heirs in indivision fail to agree as to the composition of the shares, the shares are composed by an expert designated by the court; if the failure to agree concerns the allotment of the shares, the allotment is made by a drawing of lots. Before the drawing, each heir in indivision may contest the composition of the shares. 1991, c. 64, a. 854; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II PREFERENTIAL ALLOTMENTS AND CONTESTATION 855. Each heir receives his share of the property of the succession in kind, and may apply for the allotment, by preference, of particular property or a share.
### Chunk 879

1991, c. 64, a. 855; I. N. 20140501. 856. The surviving married or civil union spouse may, in preference to any other heir, require that the family residence or the rights conferring use of it, together with the movable property serving for the use of the household, be placed in his or her share. If the value of the property exceeds the share due to the spouse, he or she keeps the property, subject to the payment of an equalizing sum. 1991, c. 64, a. 856; 2002, c. 6, s. 47; I.
### Chunk 880

N. 20140501. 857. Subject to the rights of the surviving married or civil union spouse, if several heirs apply for the allotment by preference of the immovable that served as the residence of the deceased, preference goes to the person who was residing there. 1991, c. 64, a. 857; 2002, c. 6, s. 48; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 203 of 556 ### Page 204 858. Notwithstanding any objection or application for an allotment by preference presented by another co partitioner, the enterprise, or the shares or other securities connected with the enterprise, are allotted by preference to the heir who was actively participating in the operation of the enterprise at the time of the death.
### Chunk 881

1991, c. 64, a. 858; I. N. 20140501. 859. If several heirs assert the same right of preference or if an application for an allotment is contested, the contestation is settled by a drawing of lots or, if it concerns the allotment of the residence, the enterprise or the securities connected with the enterprise, by the court. In this case, account is taken of, among other things, the interests involved, the reasons for the preference of each party or the degree of his participation in the enterprise or in the maintenance of the residence.
### Chunk 882

1991, c. 64, a. 859; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 117. 860. Where the contestation among the copartitioners is over the determination or payment of an equalizing sum, the court determines it and may, if necessary, fix the appropriate terms and conditions of guarantee and payment in the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 860; I. N. 20140501. 861. The property is appraised according to its condition and value at the time of partition. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 883

861. 862. If certain property cannot be conveniently partitioned or allotted, the interested persons may decide to sell it. 1991, c. 64, a. 862. 863. If the interested persons cannot agree, the court may, where applicable, designate experts to evaluate the property, order the sale of the property that cannot conveniently be partitioned or allotted and fix the terms and conditions of sale; or it may order a stay of partition for the time it indicates. 1991, c. 64, a. 863. 864.
### Chunk 884

In order that the partition not be made in fraud of their rights, the creditors of the succession and those of an heir may be present at the partition and intervene at their own expense. 1991, c. 64, a. 864; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III DELIVERY OF TITLES 865. After partition, the titles common to all or part of the inheritance are delivered to the person chosen by the heirs to act as depositary, on the condition that he allow the copartitioners to make use of them at their request.
### Chunk 885

Failing agreement on the choice, it is made by a drawing of lots. 1991, c. 64, a. 865; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 118. 866. At partition, any heir who so requests may obtain, at common expense, a copy of the titles to property in which he retains rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 866; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 204 of 556 ### Page 205 CHAPTER III RETURN DIVISION I RETURN OF GIFTS AND LEGACIES 867. With a view to partition, each coheir is bound to return to the mass only what he has received from the deceased by gift or by will under an express obligation to return it.
### Chunk 886

A successor who renounces the succession is under no obligation to make any return. 1991, c. 64, a. 867. 868. A person who represents another in the succession is bound to return what the person represented would have had to return, in addition to what he is bound to return in his own right. A return is due even if the person who represents the other has renounced the succession of the person represented. 1991, c. 64, a. 868. 869. A return is made only to the succession of the donor or of the testator.
### Chunk 887

It is due only from one coheir to another and is not due to the legatees by particular title or to the creditors of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 869. 870. A return is made by taking less. Any provision requiring the heir to make a return in kind is without effect. However, the heir may elect to make the return in kind if he still owns the property, unless he has charged it with a usufruct, servitude, hypothec or other real right. 1991, c. 64, a. 870; 2002, c. 19, s. 15.
### Chunk 888

871. Each coheir to whom a return by taking less is due pretakes from the mass of the succession property equal in value to the amount of the return. As far as possible, pretakings are made in property of the same kind and quality as the property due to be returned. If it is impossible to pretake in the manner described, the heir returning may either pay the cash value of the property received or allow each coheir to pretake other property of equivalent value from the mass. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 889

871; 2016, c. 4, s. 119. 872. A return by taking less may also be made by imputing the cash value of the property received to the share of the heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 872; I. N. 20140501. 873. Unless otherwise provided in the gift or will, property returned by taking less is valued at the time of partition if it is still in the hands of the heir, or on the date of alienation if it was alienated before partition. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 205 of 556 ### Page 206 Bequeathed property, and that which remains in the succession, is valued according to its condition and value at the time of partition.
### Chunk 890

1991, c. 64, a. 873. 874. The value of property returned by taking less, or returned in kind, shall be reduced by the increase in value of the property resulting from the disbursements or personal initiative of the heir returning it. It is also reduced by the amount of the necessary disbursements. Conversely, the value is increased by the decrease in value resulting from the acts or omissions of the heir making the return. 1991, c. 64, a. 874; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s.
### Chunk 891

120. 875. The heir is entitled to retain the property due to be returned in kind until he has been reimbursed the amounts he is owed. 1991, c. 64, a. 875. 876. An heir is bound to make a return in regard to property whose loss results from his acts or omissions; he is not bound to do so if the loss results from superior force. In either case, he shall return any indemnity paid to him for the loss of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 876; I. N. 20140501. 877. The copartitioners may agree that property charged with a hypothec or other real right be returned in kind; the return is then made without prejudice to the holder of the right.
### Chunk 892

The obligation resulting therefrom is, in the partition of the succession, borne by the heir who makes the return. 1991, c. 64, a. 877; I. N. 20140501. 878. The fruits and revenues of the property given or bequeathed, if the property is returned in kind, or the interest on the amount returnable, are also returnable from the opening of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 878. DIVISION II RETURN OF DEBTS 879. An heir coming to a partition shall return to the mass the debts he owes to the deceased; he shall also return the amounts he owes to his copartitioners by reason of the indivision.
### Chunk 893

These debts are subject to return even if they are not due when partition takes place; they are not subject to return if the testator provided for release therefrom to take effect at the opening of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 879. 880. If the amount in capital and interest of the debt to be returned exceeds the value of the hereditary share of the heir who is bound to make the return, the heir remains indebted for the excess and shall pay it according to the terms and conditions attached to the debt.
### Chunk 894

1991, c. 64, a. 880. 881. If an heir bound to make a return has a claim of his own to make, even though it is not exigible at the time of partition, compensation is effected and he is bound to return only the balance of his debt. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 206 of 556 ### Page 207 Compensation is also effected if the claim exceeds the debt and the heir remains creditor for the excess. 1991, c. 64, a. 881; I. N. 20140501. 882.
### Chunk 895

A return is made by taking less. The pretaking effected by the coheirs or the imputation of the amount to the share of the heir may be set up against the personal creditors of the heir who is bound to make the return. 1991, c. 64, a. 882; I. N. 20140501. 883. A return shall be made of the value of the debt in capital and interest at the time of partition. A returnable debt bears interest from the death if it precedes the death and from the date when it arose if it arose after the death.
### Chunk 896

1991, c. 64, a. 883. CHAPTER IV EFFECTS OF PARTITION DIVISION I THE DECLARATORY EFFECT OF PARTITION 884. Partition is declaratory of ownership. Each copartitioner is deemed to have inherited, alone and directly, all the property included in his share or which devolves to him through any partial or complete partition. He is deemed to have owned the property from the death, and never to have owned the other property of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 884. 885. Any act the object of which is to terminate indivision between copartitioners is equivalent to a partition, even though the act is described as a sale, an exchange, a transaction or otherwise.
### Chunk 897

1991, c. 64, a. 885. 886. Subject to the provisions concerning the administration of undivided property and the juridical relationships between an heir and his successors, acts performed by an heir in indivision and real rights granted by him in property which has not been allotted to him may not be set up against any other heirs in indivision who have not consented to them. 1991, c. 64, a. 886; I. N. 20140501. 887. Acts validly made during indivision resulting from death retain their effect, regardless of which heir receives the property at partition.
### Chunk 898

Each heir is then deemed to have made the acts concerning the property which devolves to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 887. 888. The declaratory effect also applies to claims against third persons, to any assignment of these claims made during indivision by one of the coheirs and to any seizure in the hands of a third person of the claims by the creditors of one of the coheirs. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 207 of 556 ### Page 208 The setting up of the allotment of claims against debtors is subject to the rules of the Book on Obligations relating to assignment of claims.
### Chunk 899

1991, c. 64, a. 888; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, . s 121. DIVISION II WARRANTY OF COPARTITIONERS 889. Copartitioners are warrantors towards each other only for the disturbances and evictions arising from a cause prior to the partition. Nevertheless, each copartitioner remains a warrantor for any eviction caused by his personal acts or omissions. 1991, c. 64, a. 889; I. N. 20140501. 890. The insolvency of the debtor of a claim devolving to one of the copartitioners gives rise to a warranty in the same manner as an eviction, if the insolvency occurred prior to partition.
### Chunk 900

1991, c. 64, a. 890; I. N. 20140501. 891. The warranty does not arise if the eviction has been excepted by a stipulation in the act of partition; it terminates if the copartitioner is evicted through his own fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 891. 892. Each copartitioner is personally bound in proportion to his share to indemnify his copartitioner for the loss which the eviction has caused him. The loss is valued as on the day of the partition. 1991, c. 64, a. 892. 893. If one of the copartitioners is insolvent, the indemnity for which he is bound shall be divided proportionately between the warrantee and all the solvent copartitioners.
### Chunk 901

1991, c. 64, a. 893; I. N. 20140501. 894. The action in warranty is prescribed by three years from eviction or discovery of the disturbance, or from partition if it is caused by the insolvency of a debtor of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 894; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER V NULLITY OF PARTITION 895. Partition, even partial, may be annulled for the same causes as contracts. However, instead of an annulment, a supplementary or corrective partition may be effected in any case where it is to the advantage of the copartitioners.
### Chunk 902

1991, c. 64, a. 895; I. N. 20140501. 896. Mere omission of undivided property does not give rise to an action in nullity, but only to a supplementary partition. 1991, c. 64, a. 896. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 208 of 556 ### Page 209 897. In deciding whether lesion has occurred, the value of the property is considered as at the time of partition. 1991, c. 64, a. 897. 898. The defendant in an action in nullity of partition may, in all cases, terminate the action and prevent a new partition by offering and delivering to the plaintiff the supplement from the defendant’s share of the succession, in money or in kind.
### Chunk 903

1991, c. 64, a. 898; I. N. 20140501. BOOK FOUR PROPERTY GENERAL PROVISION 2015, c. 35, s. 1. 898. 1. Animals are not things. They are sentient beings and have biological needs. In addition to the provisions of special Acts which protect animals, the provisions of this Code and of any other Act concerning property nonetheless apply to animals. 2015, c. 35, s. 1. TITLE ONE KINDS OF PROPERTY AND ITS APPROPRIATION CHAPTER I KINDS OF PROPERTY 899. Property, whether corporeal or incorporeal, is divided into immovables and movables.
### Chunk 904

1991, c. 64, a. 899. 900. Land, and any constructions and works of a permanent nature located thereon and anything forming an integral part thereof, are immovables. Plants and minerals, as long as they are not separated or extracted from the land, are also immovables. Fruits and other products of the soil may be considered to be movables, however, when they are the object of an act of disposition. 1991, c. 64, a. 900; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; 2016, c. 4, s. 122. 901. Movables incorporated with an immovable that lose their individuality and ensure the utility of the immovable form an integral part of the immovable.
### Chunk 905

1991, c. 64, a. 901. 902. Integral parts of an immovable that are temporarily detached therefrom retain their immovable character if they are destined to be put back. 1991, c. 64, a. 902. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 209 of 556 ### Page 210 903. Movables which are permanently physically attached or joined to an immovable without losing their individuality and without being incorporated with the immovable are immovables for as long as they remain there and ensure the utility of the immovable.
### Chunk 906

However, movables which, in the immovable, are used to operate an enterprise or to carry on activities remain movables. 1991, c. 64, a. 903; 2013, c. 27, s. 28. 904. Real rights in immovables, as well as actions to assert such rights or to obtain possession of immovables, are immovables. 1991, c. 64, a. 904. 905. Things which can be moved are movables. 1991, c. 64, a. 905; 2015, c. 35, s. 2. 906. Waves or energy harnessed and put to use by man, whether their source is movable or immovable, are deemed corporeal movables.
### Chunk 907

1991, c. 64, a. 906. 907. All other property, if not qualified by law, is movable. 1991, c. 64, a. 907. CHAPTER II PROPERTY IN RELATION TO THAT WHICH IT PRODUCES 1991, c. 64, c. II; I. N. 20140501. 908. Property, according to its relation to other property, may be divided into capital, and fruits and revenues. 1991, c. 64, a. 908; I. N. 20140501. 909. Property that produces fruits and revenues, property appropriated for the service or operation of an enterprise, shares of a legal person or partnership, the reinvestment of the fruits and revenues, the price for any disposal of capital or its reinvestment, and expropriation or insurance indemnities in replacement of capital, are capital.
### Chunk 908

Capital also includes rights of intellectual or industrial property except sums derived therefrom without alienation of the rights, bonds and other loan certificates payable in cash and rights the exercise of which tends to increase the capital, such as the right to subscribe to securities of a legal person, limited partnership or trust. 1991, c. 64, a. 909; 2016, c. 4, s. 123. 910. Fruits and revenues are that which is produced by property without any alteration to its substance or that which is derived from the use of capital.
### Chunk 909

They also include rights the exercise of which tends to increase the fruits and revenues of the property. Fruits comprise things spontaneously produced by property or produced by the cultivation or working of land. Fruits also comprise the increase of animals and that which they produce. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 210 of 556 ### Page 211 Revenues comprise sums of money yielded by property, such as rents, interest and dividends, except those representing the distribution of capital of a legal person; they also comprise sums received by reason of the resiliation or renewal of a lease or of prepayment, or sums allotted or collected in similar circumstances.
### Chunk 910

1991, c. 64, a. 910; 2015, c. 35, s. 3. CHAPTER III PROPERTY IN RELATION TO PERSONS HAVING RIGHTS IN IT OR POSSESSION OF IT 911. A person, alone or with others, may hold a right of ownership or other real right in property, or have possession of the property. A person also may hold or administer the property of others or be trustee of property appropriated to a particular purpose. 1991, c. 64, a. 911; I. N. 20140501. 912. The holder of a right of ownership or other real right has the right to take part in judicial proceedings to have his right acknowledged.
### Chunk 911

1991, c. 64, a. 912; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 124. 913. Certain things may not be appropriated; their use, common to all, is governed by general laws and, in certain respects, by this Code. However, water and air not intended for public utility may be appropriated if collected and placed in receptacles. 1991, c. 64, a. 913. 914. Certain other things, being without an owner, are not the subject of any right, but may nevertheless be appropriated by occupation if the person taking them does so with the intention of becoming their owner.
### Chunk 912

1991, c. 64, a. 914; I. N. 20151101. 915. Property belongs to persons or to the State or, in certain cases, is appropriated to a purpose. 1991, c. 64, a. 915. 916. Property is acquired by contract, succession, occupation, prescription, accession or any other mode provided by law. No one may appropriate property of the State for himself by occupation, prescription or accession except property the State has acquired by succession, vacancy or confiscation, so long as it has not been mingled with its other property.
### Chunk 913

Nor may anyone acquire for himself property of legal persons established in the public interest that is appropriated to public utility. 1991, c. 64, a. 916. 917. Property confiscated under the law is, upon being confiscated, property of the State or, in certain cases, of the legal person established in the public interest authorized by law to confiscate it. 1991, c. 64, a. 917. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 211 of 556 ### Page 212 918.
### Chunk 914

Parts of the territory not owned by natural persons or legal persons nor transferred to a trust patrimony belong to the State and form part of its domain. The State is presumed to have the original titles to such property. 1991, c. 64, a. 918. 919. The beds of navigable and floatable lakes and watercourses are property of the State up to the high water line. The beds of nonnavigable and nonfloatable lakes and watercourses bordering lands alienated by the State after 9 February 1918 also are property of the State up to the highwater line; before that date, ownership of the riparian land carried with it, upon alienation, ownership of the beds of nonnavigable and nonfloatable watercourses.
### Chunk 915

In all cases, the law or the act of concession may provide otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 919. 920. Any person may travel on watercourses and lakes provided he gains legal access to them, does not encroach on the rights of the riparian owners, does not set foot on the banks and complies with the conditions of use of the water. 1991, c. 64, a. 920; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER IV CERTAIN DE FACTO RELATIONSHIPS CONCERNING PROPERTY DIVISION I POSSESSION § 1. — The nature of possession 921.
### Chunk 916

Possession is the exercise in fact, by a person himself or by another person having detention of the property, of a real right, with the intention of acting as the holder of that right. The intention is presumed. Where it is lacking, there is merely detention. 1991, c. 64, a. 921. 922. Only peaceful, continuous, public and unequivocal possession produces effects in law. 1991, c. 64, a. 922. 923. A person having begun to detain property on behalf of another or with acknowledgement of superior domain is presumed to continue to detain it in that quality unless interversion of title is proved on the basis of unequivocal facts.
### Chunk 917

1991, c. 64, a. 923; I. N. 20140501. 924. Merely facultative acts or acts of sufferance do not found possession. 1991, c. 64, a. 924. 925. The present possessor is presumed to have been in continuous possession from the time he came into possession; he may join his possession to that of his predecessors in title. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 212 of 556 ### Page 213 Possession is continuous even if its exercise is temporarily prevented or interrupted.
### Chunk 918

1991, c. 64, a. 925; I. N. 20140501. 926. Defective possession begins to produce effects only from the time the defect ceases. Successors by whatever title do not suffer from defects in the possession of their predecessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 926. 927. No thief, receiver of stolen goods or defrauder may invoke the effects of possession, but his successors by whatever title may do so if they were unaware of the defect. 1991, c. 64, a. 927. § 2. — Effects of possession 928.
### Chunk 919

A possessor is presumed to hold the real right he is exercising. A person contesting that presumption has the burden of proving his own right and, as the case may be, that the possessor has no title, a defective title, or defective possession. 1991, c. 64, a. 928. 929. A possessor in continuous possession for more than a year has a right of action against any person who disturbs his possession or dispossesses him, in order to put an end to the disturbance or be put back into possession.
### Chunk 920

1991, c. 64, a. 929; I. N. 20140501. 930. Possession vests the possessor with the real right he is exercising if he complies with the rules on prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 930. 931. A possessor in good faith need not render account of the fruits and revenues of the property, and he bears the costs he incurred to produce them. A possessor in bad faith shall, after compensating for the costs, remit the fruits and revenues from the day he began to be in bad faith. 1991, c.
### Chunk 921

64, a. 931; I. N. 20140501. 932. A possessor is in good faith if, when his possession begins, he is justified in believing he holds the real right he is exercising. His good faith ceases from the time his lack of title or the defects of his possession or title are notified to him by a civil proceeding. 1991, c. 64, a. 932. 933. A possessor may be reimbursed or indemnified, in accordance with the rules in the chapter on accession, for the constructions, plantations and works he has made.

Things without an owner are things that belong to no one or that have been abandoned. Movables of slight value or in a very deteriorated condition that are left in a public place, including a public road or a vehicle used for public transportation, are deemed abandoned things.
### Chunk 923

1991, c. 64, a. 934; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2015, c. 35, s. 4. 935. A movable without an owner belongs to the person who appropriates it for himself by occupation. An abandoned movable, if no one appropriates it for himself, belongs to the municipality that collects it in its territory, or to the State. 1991, c. 64, a. 935. 936. An immovable without an owner belongs to the State. Any person may nevertheless acquire it by natural accession or prescription unless the State has possession of it or is declared the owner of it by a notice of the Minister of Revenue registered in the land register.
### Chunk 924

1991, c. 64, a. 936; 2005, c. 44, s. 54; I. N. 20151101. 937. Things without an owner which the State appropriates for itself are administered by the Minister of Revenue, who disposes of them according to law. 1991, c. 64, a. 937; 2005, c. 44, s. 54. 938. Treasure belongs to the finder if he finds it on his own land; if it is found on the land of another, one half belongs to the owner of the land and onehalf to the finder, unless the finder was acting for the owner.
### Chunk 925

1991, c. 64, a. 938. § 2. — Lost or forgotten movables 939. A movable that is lost or that is forgotten in the hands of a third person or in a public place continues to belong to its owner. The movable may not be acquired by occupation, but may be prescribed by the person who detains it, as may the price subrogated thereto. 1991, c. 64, a. 939. 940. The finder of a thing shall attempt to find its owner; if he finds him, he shall return it to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 940.
### Chunk 926

941. The finder of a lost thing, in order to acquire, by prescription, ownership of it or of the price subrogated to it, shall declare the fact that he has found it to a peace officer, to the municipality in whose territory it was found or to the person in charge of the place where it was found. He may then, at his option, keep the thing, dispose of it in the manner of a person having detention or hand it over for detention to the person to whom he made the declaration. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 927

941. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 214 of 556 ### Page 215 942. The holder of a found thing, including the State or a municipality, may sell it if it is not claimed within 60 days. The sale of the thing is held by auction and on the expiry of not less than 10 days after publication of a notice of sale in a newspaper circulated in the locality where the thing was found, stating the nature of the thing and indicating the place, day and hour of the sale.
### Chunk 928

The holder may dispose of the thing immediately, however, if it is perishable. Also, if there is no bidder at the auction, he may sell the thing by agreement, give it to a charitable institution or, if it is impossible to dispose of it in this way, destroy it. 1991, c. 64, a. 942. 943. The State or a municipality may, in the manner of the holder of a found thing, sell movable property in its hands by auction, without further delay than that required for publication, in the following cases: (1) the owner of the property claims it but neglects or refuses to reimburse the

1991, c. 64, a. 943; 2016, c. 4, s. 125. 944. Where a thing that has been entrusted for safekeeping, work or processing is not claimed within 90 days from completion of the work or the agreed time, it is considered to be forgotten and the holder, after having given notice of the same length of time to the person who entrusted him with the thing, may dispose of it. 1991, c. 64, a. 944. 945. The holder of a thing entrusted but forgotten disposes of it by auction sale as in the case of a found thing, or by agreement.
### Chunk 930

He may also give a thing that cannot be sold to a charitable institution or, if that is not possible, dispose of it as he sees fit. 1991, c. 64, a. 945. 946. The owner of a lost or forgotten thing may revendicate it, so long as his right of ownership has not been prescribed, by offering to pay the cost of its administration and, where applicable, the value of the work done. The holder of the thing may retain it until payment. If the thing has been alienated, the owner’s right is exercised, notwithstanding article 1714, only against what is left of the price of sale, after deducting the cost of its administration and alienation and the value of the work done.

1991, c. 64, a. 946. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 215 of 556 ### Page 216 TITLE TWO OWNERSHIP CHAPTER I NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP 947. Ownership is the right to use, enjoy and dispose of property fully and freely, subject to the limits and conditions for doing so determined by law. Ownership may be in various modalities and dismemberments. 1991, c. 64, a. 947; I. N. 20151101. 948. Ownership of property gives a right to what it produces and to what is united to it, naturally or artificially, from the time of union.
### Chunk 932

This right is called a right of accession. 1991, c. 64, a. 948; 1992, c. 57, s. 716. 949. The fruits and revenues of property belong to the owner, who bears the costs he incurred to produce them. 1991, c. 64, a. 949. 950. The owner of the property assumes the risks of loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 950. 951. Ownership of the soil carries with it ownership of what is above and what is below the surface. The owner may make such constructions, works or plantations above or below the surface as he sees fit; he is bound to respect, among other things, the public rights in mines, petroleum, sheets of water and underground streams.
### Chunk 933

1991, c. 64, a. 951; 2016, c. 4, s. 126; 2016, c. 35, s. 23. 952. No owner may be compelled to transfer his ownership except by expropriation according to law for public utility and in return for a just and prior indemnity. 1991, c. 64, a. 952; I. N. 20140501. 953. The owner of property has a right to revendicate it against the possessor or the person detaining it without right, and may object to any encroachment or to any use not authorized by him or by law. 1991, c.
### Chunk 934

64, a. 953. CHAPTER II ACCESSION DIVISION I IMMOVABLE ACCESSION 954. Accession of movable or immovable property to an immovable may be voluntary or involuntary. Accession is artificial in the first case, natural in the second. 1991, c. 64, a. 954. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 216 of 556 ### Page 217 § 1. — Artificial accession 955. Constructions, works or plantations on an immovable are presumed to have been made by the owner of the immovable at his own expense and to belong to him.
### Chunk 935

1991, c. 64, a. 955. 956. The owner of an immovable becomes the owner by accession of the constructions, works or plantations he has made with materials which do not belong to him, but he is bound to pay the value, at the time they were incorporated, of the materials used. The previous owner of the materials has no right to remove them nor any obligation to take them back. 1991, c. 64, a. 956. 957. The owner of an immovable acquires by accession ownership of the constructions, works or plantations made on his immovable by a possessor, whether the disbursements were necessary, useful or for amenities.
### Chunk 936

1991, c. 64, a. 957. 958. The owner shall reimburse the possessor for the necessary disbursements, even if the constructions, works or plantations no longer exist. If the possessor is in bad faith, however, compensation may be claimed for the fruits and revenues collected, after deducting the costs incurred to produce them. 1991, c. 64, a. 958. 959. The owner shall reimburse the useful disbursements made by a possessor in good faith, if the constructions, works or plantations still exist; he may also, if he chooses, pay him an indemnity equal to the increase in value.
### Chunk 937

The owner may, on the same conditions, reimburse the useful disbursements made by the possessor in bad faith; he may in that case effect compensation for the fruits and revenues owed to him by the possessor. The owner may also compel the possessor in bad faith to remove the constructions, works or plantations and to restore the place to its former condition; if such restoration is impossible, the owner may keep them without indemnity or compel the possessor to remove them. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 938

959; I. N. 20140501. 960. The owner may compel the possessor to acquire the immovable and to pay him its value if the useful disbursements made are costly and represent a considerable proportion of that value. 1991, c. 64, a. 960. 961. A possessor in good faith who has made disbursements for amenities for himself may, at the owner’s option, either remove, without causing damage to the place, the constructions, works or plantations he has made, if that can be done advantageously, or abandon them.
### Chunk 939

If he abandons them, the owner is bound to reimburse him for either their cost or the increase in value of the immovable, whichever is less. 1991, c. 64, a. 961; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 217 of 556 ### Page 218 962. The owner may compel the possessor in bad faith to remove the constructions, works or plantations he has made as amenities for himself and to restore the place to its former condition; if such restoration is impossible, he may keep them without indemnity or compel the possessor to remove them.
### Chunk 940

1991, c. 64, a. 962; I. N. 20140501. 963. A possessor in good faith has a right to retain the immovable until he has been reimbursed for necessary or useful disbursements. A possessor in bad faith has that right only as regards the necessary disbursements he has made. 1991, c. 64, a. 963; I. N. 20140501. 964. Disbursements made by a person detaining property are dealt with according to the rules prescribed for disbursements made by a possessor in bad faith. The person detaining the property is under no obligation to acquire it, however.
### Chunk 941

1991, c. 64, a. 964. § 2. — Natural accession 965. Alluvion becomes the property of the riparian owner. Alluvion is the deposits of earth and augmentations which are gradually and imperceptibly formed on riparian lands of a watercourse. 1991, c. 64, a. 965. 966. Accretions left by the imperceptible recession of running water from one bank while it encroaches upon the opposite bank become the property of the riparian owner on the bank gradually added to, and the riparian owner on the opposite bank has no claim for the lost land.
### Chunk 942

That right does not exist as regards accretions from the sea, which form part of the domain of the State. 1991, c. 64, a. 966; I. N. 20140501. 967. If, by sudden force, a watercourse carries away a large and recognizable part of a riparian land to a lower land or to the opposite bank, the owner of the part carried away may reclaim it. The owner is bound, on pain of forfeiture, to reclaim the part carried away within one year after the owner of the land it has attached to takes possession of it.
### Chunk 943

1991, c. 64, a. 967. 968. An island formed in the bed of a watercourse belongs to the owner of the bed. 1991, c. 64, a. 968. 969. If, in forming a new branch, a watercourse cuts a riparian land and thereby forms an island, the owner of the riparian land retains the ownership of the island so formed. 1991, c. 64, a. 969. 970. If a watercourse abandons its bed and forms a new bed, the former bed belongs to the owners of the newly occupied land, each in proportion to the land he has lost.

1991, c. 64, a. 970. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 218 of 556 ### Page 219 DIVISION II MOVABLE ACCESSION 971. Where movables belonging to several owners have been intermingled or united in such a way as to be no longer separable without deterioration or without excessive labour and cost, the new thing belongs to the owner having contributed most to its creation by the value of the original thing or by his work. 1991, c. 64, a. 971. 972.
### Chunk 945

A person having worked on or processed material which did not belong to him acquires ownership of the new thing if the work or processing is worth more than the material used. 1991, c. 64, a. 972. 973. The owner of the new thing shall pay the value of the material or labour to the person having supplied it. If it is impossible to determine who contributed most to the creation of the new thing, the interested persons are its coowners in indivision. 1991, c. 64, a. 973; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 946

974. The person bound to return the new thing may retain it until its owner pays him the indemnity he owes him. 1991, c. 64, a. 974; I. N. 20140501. 975. In circumstances not provided for, the right of accession with respect to movable property is entirely subordinate to the principles of equity. 1991, c. 64, a. 975; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER III SPECIAL RULES ON THE OWNERSHIP OF IMMOVABLES DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISION 976. Neighbours shall suffer the normal neighbourhood annoyances that are not beyond the limit of tolerance they owe each other, according to the nature or location of their land or local usage.
### Chunk 947

1991, c. 64, a. 976; 2016, c. 4, s. 127. DIVISION II LIMITS AND BOUNDARIES OF LAND 977. The limits of land are determined by the titles, the cadastral plan and the boundary lines of the land, and by any other useful indication or document, if need be. 1991, c. 64, a. 977. 978. Every owner may compel his neighbour to have the boundaries between their contiguous lands determined in order to fix the boundary markers, set displaced or missing boundary markers back in place, verify ancient boundary markers or rectify the dividing line between their properties.
### Chunk 948

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 219 of 556 ### Page 220 Failing agreement between them, the owner shall first make a demand to his neighbour requiring to consent to having the boundaries determined and to agree upon the choice of a land surveyor to carry out the necessary operations, in accordance with the rules in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). The minutes of the boundarymarking operations must be registered in the land register; the boundary determination report may be attached to the minutes.
### Chunk 949

1991, c. 64, a. 978; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2014, c. 1, s. 788; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). DIVISION III WATERS 979. Lower land is subject to receiving water flowing onto it naturally from higher land. The owner of lower land has no right to erect works to prevent the natural flow. The owner of higher land has no right to aggravate the condition of lower land, and is not presumed to do so if he carries out work to facilitate the natural runoff or, where his land is devoted to agriculture, he carries out drainage work.
### Chunk 950

1991, c. 64, a. 979. 980. An owner who has a spring on his land may use it and dispose of it. He may, for his needs, use water from the lakes and ponds that are entirely on his land, taking care to preserve their quality. 1991, c. 64, a. 980. 981. A riparian owner may, for his needs, make use of a lake, the headwaters of a watercourse or any other watercourse bordering or crossing his land. As the water leaves his land, he shall direct it, not substantially changed in quality or quantity, into its regular course.
### Chunk 951

No riparian owner may by his use of the water prevent other riparian owners from exercising the same right. 1991, c. 64, a. 981. 982. Unless it is contrary to the general interest, a person having a right to use a spring, lake, sheet of water, underground stream or any running water may, to prevent the water from being polluted or depleted, require the destruction or modification of any works by which the water is being polluted or depleted. 1991, c. 64, a. 982; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 952

983. Roofs are required to be built in such a manner that water, snow and ice fall on the owner’s land. 1991, c. 64, a. 983. DIVISION IV TREES 984. Fruit that falls from a tree onto neighbouring land belongs to the owner of the tree. 1991, c. 64, a. 984. 985. If branches or roots extend over or upon an owner’s land from the neighbouring land and seriously obstruct its use, the owner may request his neighbour to cut them and, if he refuses, compel him to do so. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 220 of 556 ### Page 221 If a tree on the neighbouring land is in danger of falling on the owner’s land, he may compel his neighbour to fell the tree, or to right it.
### Chunk 953

1991, c. 64, a. 985. 986. The owner of land used for agricultural purposes may compel his neighbour to fell the trees along and not more than five metres from the dividing line, if they are seriously damaging to his operations, except trees in an orchard or sugar bush and trees preserved to embellish the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 986; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION V ACCESS TO AND PROTECTION OF THE LAND OF ANOTHER 987. Every owner of land, after having been notified verbally or in writing, shall allow his neighbour access to it if that is necessary to make or maintain a construction, works or plantation on the neighbouring land.
### Chunk 954

1991, c. 64, a. 987. 988. An owner bound to give access to his land is entitled to reparation for injury he suffers as a result of that sole fact and to the restoration of his land to its former condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 988; I. N. 20140501. 989. Where a thing ends up on the land of another by the effect of a natural or superior force, the owner of that land shall allow the thing to be searched for and removed, unless he immediately searches for it himself and returns it.
### Chunk 955

The thing does not cease to belong to its owner unless he abandons the search, in which case it is acquired by the owner of the land unless he compels the owner of the thing to remove it and to restore his land to its former condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 989; 2015, c. 35, s. 5. 990. The owner of land shall do any repair or demolition work needed to prevent the collapse of a construction or works situated on his land that is in danger of falling onto the neighbouring land, including a public road.
### Chunk 956

1991, c. 64, a. 990. 991. Where the owner of land erects a construction or works or makes a plantation on his land, he may not disturb the neighbouring land or undermine the constructions, works or plantations situated on it. 1991, c. 64, a. 991. 992. Where an owner has, in good faith, built beyond the limits of his land on a parcel of land belonging to another, he shall, as the owner of the land he has encroached upon elects, acquire the parcel by paying him its value, or pay him an indemnity for the temporary loss of use of the parcel.
### Chunk 957

If the encroachment is a considerable one, causes serious injury or is made in bad faith, the owner of the land encroached upon may compel the builder to acquire his immovable and to pay him its value, or to remove the constructions and to restore the place to its former condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 992; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 221 of 556 ### Page 222 DIVISION VI VIEWS 993. No person may have upon neighbouring land direct views less than 150 cm from the dividing line.
### Chunk 958

This rule does not apply in the case of views on the public thoroughfare or on a public park or in the case of panelled doors or doors with translucid glass. 1991, c. 64, a. 993; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501. 994. The distance of 150 centimetres is measured from the exterior facing of the wall where the opening is made and perpendicularly therefrom to the dividing line. In the case of a projecting window, the distance is measured from the exterior line. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 959

994. 995. Fixed translucid lights may be made in a wall that is not a common wall, even if it is less than 150 cm from the dividing line. 1991, c. 64, a. 995; I. N. 20140501. 996. A coowner of a common wall has no right to make any opening in it without the agreement of the other coowner. 1991, c. 64, a. 996. DIVISION VII RIGHT OF WAY 997. The owner of land enclosed by that of others in such a way that there is no access or only an inadequate, difficult or impassable access to it from the public road may, if all his neighbours refuse to grant him a servitude or another mode of access, require one of them to provide him with the necessary right of way to use and exploit his land.
### Chunk 960

Where an owner claims his right under this article, he pays an indemnity proportionate to any injury he might cause. 1991, c. 64, a. 997; I. N. 20140501. 998. Right of way is claimed from the owner whose land affords the most natural way out, taking into consideration the condition of the place, the benefit to the enclosed land and the inconvenience caused by the right of way to the land on which it is exercised. 1991, c. 64, a. 998. 999. If land is enclosed as a result of the division of land pursuant to a partition, will or contract, right of way may be claimed only from a copartitioner, heir or contracting party, not from the owner whose land affords the most natural way out, and in this case the right of way is provided without indemnity.
### Chunk 961

1991, c. 64, a. 999; I. N. 20140501. 1000. The beneficiary of a right of way shall build and maintain all the works necessary to ensure that his right is exercised under conditions that cause the least possible damage to the land on which it is exercised. 1991, c. 64, a. 1000. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 222 of 556 ### Page 223 1001. Right of way is extinguished when it ceases to be necessary for the use and exploitation of the land.
### Chunk 962

The indemnity is not reimbursed, but if it was payable as an annual rent or by instalments, future payments of these are no longer due. 1991, c. 64, a. 1001; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION VIII COMMON FENCES AND WORKS 1002. Any owner of land may fence it, at his own expense, with walls, ditches, hedges or any other kind of fence. He may also require his neighbour to make, in equal portions or at common expense, on the dividing line between their lands, a fence suited to the situation and use made of the place.
### Chunk 963

1991, c. 64, a. 1002; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1003. A fence on the dividing line is presumed to be common. Similarly, a wall supporting buildings on either side is presumed to be common up to the point of disjunction. 1991, c. 64, a. 1003. 1004. An owner may acquire common ownership of a private wall directly adjacent to the dividing line by reimbursing the owner of the wall for one half of the cost of the section rendered common and, where applicable, one half of the value of the ground used.
### Chunk 964

The cost of the wall is assessed on the date on which it was rendered common, and account is taken of its condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 1004; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1005. Each owner may build against a common wall and set beams and joists against it. He shall obtain the concurrence of the other owner on how to proceed. In case of disagreement, the owner may apply to the court to determine the means necessary to ensure that the new works infringe the rights of the other owner as little as possible.
### Chunk 965

1991, c. 64, a. 1005. 1006. The maintenance, repair and rebuilding of a common wall are at the expense of each owner in proportion to his right. An owner who does not use the common wall may renounce his right and thereby be relieved of his obligation to share the expenses by producing a notice to that effect at the Land Registry Office and transmitting a copy of the notice to the other owners without delay. The notice entails renunciation of the right to make use of the wall. 1991, c.
### Chunk 966

64, a. 1006; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. 1007. A coowner of a common wall has a right to heighten it at his own expense after ascertaining by means of an expert appraisal that it can withstand it, and shall pay one sixth of the cost of the heightening to the other as an indemnity. If the wall cannot withstand heightening, the coowner shall rebuild the entire wall at his own expense, any additional thickness going on his own side. 1991, c. 64, a. 1007; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101.
### Chunk 967

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 223 of 556 ### Page 224 1008. The heightened part of the wall belongs to the person who made it, and the cost of its maintenance, repair and rebuilding is his responsibility. The neighbour who did not contribute to the heightening may nevertheless acquire common ownership of it by paying onehalf of the cost of the heightening or rebuilding and, where applicable, onehalf of the value of the ground provided for additional thickness.
### Chunk 968

He shall also repay any indemnity he has received. 1991, c. 64, a. 1008; I. N. 20140501. TITLE THREE MODALITIES OF OWNERSHIP I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1009. The principal modalities of ownership are coownership and superficies. 1991, c. 64, a. 1009; I. N. 20151101. 1010. Coownership is ownership of the same property, jointly and concurrently, by several persons each of whom is privately vested with a share of the right of ownership. Coownership is called undivided where the right of ownership is not accompanied by a physical division of the property.
### Chunk 969

It is called divided where the right of ownership is apportioned among the coowners in fractions, each comprising a physically divided private portion and a share of the common portions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1010; I. N. 20140501. 1011. Superficies is ownership of the constructions, works or plantations situated on an immovable belonging to another person, the owner of the subsoil. 1991, c. 64, a. 1011. CHAPTER II UNDIVIDED COOWNERSHIP DIVISION I ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVISION 1012.
### Chunk 970

Indivision arises from a contract, a succession or a judgment or by operation of law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1012; I. N. 20140501. 1013. Coowners may agree in writing to postpone the partition of property on expiry of the term provided for the indivision. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 224 of 556 ### Page 225 Such an agreement may not exceed 30 years, but is renewable. An agreement exceeding 30 years is reduced to that term. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 971

1013; I. N. 20140501. 1014. Indivision by agreement with respect to an immovable shall be published if it is to be set up against third persons. In particular, the term provided for the indivision, the identification of the shares of the co owners and, where applicable, the preemptive rights granted, or the granting of a right of use or exclusive enjoyment of a portion of the undivided property, shall be mentioned. 1991, c. 64, a. 1014; I. N. 20140501; 2016,c. 4, s. 128. DIVISION II RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF COOWNERS 1991, c.
### Chunk 972

64, Div. II; I. N. 20140501. 1015. The shares of coowners are presumed equal. Each coowner has the rights and obligations of an exclusive owner as regards his share. Thus, each may alienate or hypothecate his share and his creditors may seize it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1015; I. N. 20140501. 1016. Each coowner may make use of the undivided property provided he does not affect its destination or the rights of the other coowners. If one of the coowners has the use and exclusive enjoyment of the property, he is liable for an indemnity.
### Chunk 973

1991, c. 64, a. 1016; I. N. 20140501. 1017. The right of accession operates to the benefit of all the coowners proportionately to their share in the indivision. Nevertheless, where a coowner holds a right of use or exclusive enjoyment of a portion of the undivided property, he also has the use or exclusive enjoyment of anything joined or incorporated with that portion. 1991, c. 64, a. 1017; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 129. 1018. The fruits and revenues of the undivided property accrue to the indivision, where there is no provisional partition or any other agreement with respect to their periodic distribution.
### Chunk 974

They also accrue to the indivision if they are not claimed within three years from their due date. 1991, c. 64, a. 1018; I. N. 20140501. 1019. Coowners are liable proportionately to their shares for the costs of administration and the other common charges related to the undivided property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1019; I. N. 20140501. 1020. Each coowner is entitled to be reimbursed for necessary disbursements he has made to preserve the undivided property. For other authorized disbursements, he is entitled, at partition, to an indemnity equal to the increase in value given to the property.
### Chunk 975

Conversely, each coowner is liable for losses resulting from his act or omission that decrease the value of the undivided property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1020; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 130. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 225 of 556 ### Page 226 1021. Partition which takes place before the time fixed by the indivision agreement may not be set up against a creditor holding a hypothec on an undivided share of the property unless he has consented to the partition or unless his debtor retains a right of ownership over some portion of the property.
### Chunk 976

1991, c. 64, a. 1021; I. N. 20140501. 1022. Any coowner, within 60 days of learning that a third person has, by onerous title, acquired the share of a coowner, may exclude him from the indivision by reimbursing him for the transfer price and the expenses he has paid. This right may be exercised only within one year from the acquisition of the share. The right of withdrawal may not be exercised where the coowners have stipulated preemptive rights in the indivision agreement and where such rights, if they are rights in an immovable, have been published.
### Chunk 977

1991, c. 64, a. 1022; I. N. 20140501. 1023. A coowner having caused his address to be registered at the registry office may, within 60 days of being notified of the intention of a creditor to cause the share of a coowner to be sold or to take it in payment of an obligation, be subrogated to the rights of the creditor by paying him the debt of that coowner, with costs. A coowner not having caused his address to be registered may not set up his right of withdrawal against a creditor or a creditor’s successors.

If several coowners exercise their rights of withdrawal or subrogation against the share of a co owner, it is partitioned among them proportionately to their rights in the undivided property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1024; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III ADMINISTRATION OF UNDIVIDED PROPERTY 1025. The coowners administer the property jointly. 1991, c. 64, a. 1025; I. N. 20140501. 1026. Decisions relating to the administration of the property are taken by a majority in number and shares of the coowners.
### Chunk 979

Decisions in view of alienating or partitioning the undivided property, charging it with a real right, changing its destination or making substantial alterations to it require unanimous approval. 1991, c. 64, a. 1026; I. N. 20140501. 1027. The coowners may appoint one of their number or another person as manager and entrust him with the administration of the undivided property. Upon application by a coowner, the court may designate the manager and determine the terms and conditions of his office, where a majority in number and shares of the coowners cannot agree on whom to appoint, or where it is impossible to appoint or replace the manager.

A coowner who administers the undivided property with the knowledge of the other coowners and without objection on their part is presumed to have been appointed manager. 1991, c. 64, a. 1028; I. N. 20140501. 1029. The manager acts alone with respect to the undivided property as administrator of the property of others charged with simple administration.
### Chunk 981

1991, c. 64, a. 1029. DIVISION IV END OF INDIVISION AND PARTITION 1030. No one is bound to remain in indivision. Partition may be demanded at any time unless it has been postponed by an agreement, a testamentary provision or a judgment, or by operation of law, or unless it has become impossible because the property has been appropriated to a lasting purpose. 1991, c. 64, a. 1030; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1031. Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, threequarters of the coowners representing 90% of the shares may terminate the undivided coownership of a mainly residential immovable in order to establish divided coownership of it.
### Chunk 982

The coowners may satisfy those who object to the establishment of divided coownership and who refuse to sign the declaration of coownership by apportioning their share to them in money; the share of each co owner is then increased in proportion to his payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1031; I. N. 20140501. 1032. Upon application by a coowner, the court, to avoid a loss, may postpone the immediate partition of all or part of the property and maintain the indivision for at most two years. The decision may be revised if the causes justifying the maintenance of the indivision have ceased to exist or if the indivision has become intolerable or presents great risks for the coowners.
### Chunk 983

1991, c. 64, a. 1032; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 132. 1033. If a coowner objects to the maintenance of the indivision, the other coowners may satisfy him at any time by apportioning his share to him in kind, provided it is easily detachable from the rest of the undivided property, or in money, as he chooses. If the share is apportioned in kind, the coowners may make the allotment least prejudicial to the exercise of their rights. If the share is apportioned in money, the share of each coowner is increased in proportion to his payment.
### Chunk 984

1991, c. 64, a. 1033; I. N. 20140501. 1034. If the coowners fail to agree on the share in kind or in money to be apportioned to one of them, an appraisal or a valuation is made by a person designated by all the coowners or, if they cannot agree among themselves, by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 1034; I. N. 20140501. 1035. Creditors whose claims arise from the administration are paid out of the assets before partition. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 227 of 556 ### Page 228 No creditor, not even a hypothecary creditor, of a coowner may demand partition, except by an oblique action where the coowner could demand it himself.
### Chunk 985

1991, c. 64, a. 1035; I. N. 20140501. 1036. Indivision may be terminated by the decision of a majority in number of shares of the coowners where a substantial part of the undivided property is lost or expropriated. 1991, c. 64, a. 1036; I. N. 20140501. 1037. Indivision ends by the partition or alienation of the property. In the case of partition, the provisions relating to the partition of successions apply, adapted as required. However, the act of partition which terminates indivision, other than indivision by succession, is an act of attribution of the right of ownership.
### Chunk 986

1991, c. 64, a. 1037. CHAPTER III DIVIDED COOWNERSHIP OF IMMOVABLES DIVISION I ESTABLISHMENT OF DIVIDED COOWNERSHIP 1038. Divided coownership of an immovable is established by publication of a declaration under which ownership of the immovable is divided into fractions belonging to one or several persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 1038. 1039. Upon the publication of the declaration of coownership, the coowners as a body constitute a legal person, the objects of which are the preservation of the immovable, the maintenance and administration of the common portions, the protection of the rights appurtenant to the immovable or the coownership, as well as all business in the common interest.
### Chunk 987

The legal person must, in particular, see to it that the work necessary for the preservation and maintenance of the immovable is carried out. The legal person is called a syndicate. 1991, c. 64, a. 1039; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 29. 1040. Divided coownership of an immovable that is built by an emphyteuta or that is subject to superficies may be established if the unexpired term of the right, at the time of publication of the declaration, is more than 50 years. In cases arising under the first paragraph, each coowner, dividedly and proportionately to the relative value of his fraction, is liable for the divisible obligations of the emphyteuta or superficiary, as the case may be, towards the owner of the immovable subject to emphyteusis or superficies.
### Chunk 988

The syndicate assumes the indivisible obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 1040; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 228 of 556 ### Page 229 DIVISION II FRACTIONS OF COOWNERSHIP 1041. The relative value of each of the fractions of the divided coownership is established with reference to the value of all the fractions together, taking into account the nature, destination, dimensions and location of the private portion of each fraction, but not its use.
### Chunk 989

The relative value is determined in the declaration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1041; I. N. 20140501. 1042. Those portions of the buildings and land that are owned by a specific coowner and are for his exclusive use are called the private portions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1042; I. N. 20140501. 1043. Those portions of the buildings and land that are owned by all the coowners and serve for their common use are called the common portions. However, some of the portions may serve for the use of certain, or only one, of the coowners.
### Chunk 990

The rules regarding the common portions apply to the common portions that have restricted use. 1991, c. 64, a. 1043; I. N. 20140501. 1044. The following are presumed to be common portions: the ground, yards, verandas or balconies, parks and gardens, access ways, stairways and elevators, passageways and halls, common service areas, parking and storage areas, basements, foundations and main walls of buildings, and common equipment and apparatus, such as the central heating and airconditioning systems and the piping and wiring, including that which runs through private portions.
### Chunk 991

1991, c. 64, a. 1044; I. N. 20140501. 1045. Partitions or walls that are not part of the foundations and main walls of a building but which separate a private portion from a common portion or from another private portion are presumed common. 1991, c. 64, a. 1045. 1046. Each coowner has an undivided right of ownership in the common portions. His share of the common portions is equal to the relative value of his fraction. 1991, c. 64, a. 1046; 2016, c. 4, s. 133.
### Chunk 992

1047. Each fraction constitutes a distinct entity and may be alienated in whole or in part; the alienation includes, in each case, the share of the common portions appurtenant to the fraction, as well as the right to use the common portions for restricted use, where applicable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1047. 1048. The share of the common portions appurtenant to a fraction may not, separately from the private portion of the fraction, be the subject of alienation or an action in partition. 1991, c.
### Chunk 993

64, a. 1048; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. 1049.

1991, c. 64, a. 1049; 2000, c. 42, s. 3; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. 1050. Each fraction forms a distinct entity for the purposes of property assessment and taxation. The syndicate shall be impleaded in the case of any judicial contestation of the assessment of a fraction by a coowner. 1991, c. 64, a. 1050; 2016, c. 4, s. 134. 1051. Notwithstanding articles 2650 and 2662, a hypothec, any additional security accessory thereto or any prior claims existing at the time of registration of the declaration of coownership on the whole of an immovable held in coownership are divided among the fractions according to the relative value of each or according to any other established proportion.

1991, c. 64, a. 1051; 2016, c. 4, s. 135. DIVISION III DECLARATION OF COOWNERSHIP § 1. — Content of the declaration 1052. A declaration of coownership comprises the act constituting the coownership, the bylaws of the immovable and a description of the fractions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1052. 1053. An act constituting the coownership defines the destination of the immovable, of the private portions and of the common portions. The act also specifies the relative value of each fraction, indicating how that value was determined, the share of the common expenses and the number of votes attached to each fraction.
### Chunk 996

The act also specifies the respective powers and duties of the board of directors of the syndicate and of the general meeting of the coowners and provides any other agreement regarding the immovable or its private or common portions, including any penal clause applicable for contravening the declaration of coownership. 1991, c. 64, a. 1053; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 30. 1054. The bylaws of an immovable contain the rules on the enjoyment, use and maintenance of the private and common portions, and those on the operation and administration of the coownership.
### Chunk 997

The bylaws also deal with the procedure of assessment and collection of contributions to the common expenses. 1991, c. 64, a. 1054; I. N. 20151101. 1055. A description of the fractions contains the cadastral description of the private portions and common portions of the immovable. Such a description also contains a description of the real rights charging the immovable or existing in its favour, other than hypothecs and additional security accessory thereto. 1991, c. 64, a. 1055; I.

No declaration of coownership may impose any restriction on the rights of the coowners except restrictions justified by the destination, characteristics or location of the immovable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1056. 1057. The bylaws of the immovable may be set up against the lessee or occupant of a private portion upon his being given a copy of the bylaws or the amendments to them by the coowner or, if not by him, by the syndicate.
### Chunk 999

1991, c. 64, a. 1057. 1058. Unless express provision is made therefor in the act constituting the coownership, no fraction may be held by several persons each having a periodic and successive right of enjoyment in the fraction, nor may a fraction be alienated for that purpose. Where the act makes provision for a periodic and successive right of enjoyment, it shall indicate the number of fractions that may be held in this way, the occupancy periods, the maximum number of persons who may hold these fractions, and the rights and obligations of the occupants.

### Chunk 1001

64, a. 1059; I. N. 20140501. 1060. The declaration and any amendments to the act constituting the coownership or the description of the fractions are filed exclusively in French at the Land Registry Office. The declaration is registered in the land register under the registration numbers of the common portions and the private portions. The amendments are registered under the registration number of the common portions only, unless they directly affect a private portion. However, amendments to the bylaws of the immovable must be made expressly, in minutes or in a resolution in writing of the coowners, and it is sufficient for such amendments to be filed in the register held by the syndicate in accordance with article 1070.
### Chunk 1002

The amendments must be made exclusively in French. The emphyteuta or superficiary, if any, shall give notice of the registration to the owner of the immovable under emphyteusis or on which superficies has been established. 1991, c. 64, a. 1060; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2019, c. 28, s. 31; 2020, c. 17, s. 27; 2022, c. 14, s. 127. 1061.

### Chunk 1003

1991, c. 64, a. 1061; I. N. 20140501. 1062. The declaration of coownership binds the coowners, their successors and the persons who signed it, and produces its effects towards them from the time of its registration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1062. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 231 of 556 ### Page 232 DIVISION IV RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF COOWNERS 1063. Each coowner has the disposal of his fraction; he has free use and enjoyment of his private portion and of the common portions, provided he complies with the bylaws of the immovable and does not impair the rights of the other coowners or the destination of the immovable.
### Chunk 1004

1991, c. 64, a. 1063; I. N. 20140501. 1064. Each coowner contributes to the common expenses in proportion to the relative value of his fraction. However, only coowners who have the use of common portions for restricted use contribute to the expenses related to the maintenance and the ordinary repairs of those portions. The declaration of coownership may determine a different apportionment of the coowners’ contribution to the expenses for major repairs to common portions for restricted use and for the replacement of those portions.

A coowner who leases his private portion shall, within the same time, notify the syndicate. The coowner shall give the name of the lessee, the term of the lease and the date on which he gave the lessee a copy of the bylaws of the immovable.
### Chunk 1006

The same applies, with the necessary modifications, where the private portion is otherwise occupied. 1991, c. 64, a. 1065; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 33. 1066. No coowner may interfere with the carrying out, even inside his private portion, of work required for the preservation of the immovable decided upon by the syndicate or of urgent work. Where a private portion is leased, the syndicate gives the lessee, where applicable, the notices prescribed by articles 1922 and 1931 regarding improvements and work.
### Chunk 1007

Where a private portion is occupied otherwise than by being leased, the syndicate gives the occupant a written notice indicating the nature of the improvements and of the nonurgent work, the date on which work is to begin and an estimate of its duration and, where required, the necessary period of vacancy. 1991, c. 64, a. 1066; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 34. 1067. A coowner who, as a result of work carried out, suffers injury in the form of a permanent diminution in the value of his fraction, a grave disturbance to enjoyment, even if temporary, or through deterioration, is entitled to obtain an indemnity from the syndicate if the syndicate ordered the work or, if it did not, from the coowners who did the work.

Those obligations exist from the appointment of a new board of directors, after the developer loses control of the syndicate.
### Chunk 1010

2019, c. 28, s. 35. 1068. 2. A person who promises to buy a fraction may request the syndicate to provide him with the documents or information concerning the immovable and the syndicate that will enable him to give enlightened consent.

### Chunk 1012

The statement provided is adjusted to the last annual budget of the coowners. 1991, c. 64, a. 1069; 2002, c. 19, s. 6; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 36. DIVISION V RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SYNDICATE 1070. Among the registers of the coownership, the syndicate keeps at the disposal of the coowners a register containing the name and mailing address of each coowner; the register may also contain other personal information concerning a coowner or another occupant of the immovable if he expressly consents to it.
### Chunk 1013

In addition, the register contains the minutes of the meetings of the coowners and of the board of directors, the resolutions in writing, the bylaws of the immovable and any amendments to them, and the financial statements.

### Chunk 1014

In addition, the register contains a description of the private portions that is sufficiently precise to allow any improvements made by coowners to be identified. The same description may be valid for two or more portions having the same characteristics. 1991, c. 64, a. 1070; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 136; 2018, c. 23, s. 638; 2019, c. 28, s. 37. Concerning the maintenance log and the contingency fund study, see 2019, c. 28, s. 165(3). 1070. 1. It must be possible to consult the register and documents kept at the disposal of the coowners in the presence of a director or a person designated for that purpose by the board of directors, at reasonable hours and according to the rules provided in the bylaws of the immovable.
### Chunk 1015

Every coowner is entitled to obtain a copy of the content of the register and of any such documents for a reasonable cost. A government regulation may prescribe other conditions, rules or restrictions relating to consultation of the register, of the documents to be kept at the disposal of the coowners, and of the information they contain. 2019, c. 28, s. 38. 1070. 1. 1. The register and documents kept at the disposal of the coowners, as well as any document drawn up by the syndicate for a coowner, must be drawn up in French.
### Chunk 1016

The Office québécois de la langue française sees to the application of the first paragraph as if it were a provision of the Charter of the French language (chapter C11). 2022, c. 14, s. 128. Not in force 1070. 2. The board of directors causes a maintenance log to be established for the immovable which describes, in particular, maintenance done and maintenance required. The board of directors keeps the log up to date and has it reviewed periodically. The form and content of the maintenance log and the manner in which it is kept and reviewed, as well as the persons who may establish and review it, are determined by government regulation.
### Chunk 1017

The standards provided in the regulation may vary according to the characteristics of an immovable. 2019, c. 28, s. 38; 2024, c. 2, s. 1. 1071. The syndicate establishes, according to the estimated cost of major repairs and the cost of replacement of common portions, a contingency fund to be used exclusively for such repairs and replacement. The fund must be partly liquid and be available at short notice, and its capital must be guaranteed. The syndicate is the owner of the fund, and the fund’s use is determined by the board of directors.
### Chunk 1018

Not in force The board of directors obtains a contingency fund study establishing the sums necessary for the fund to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of major repairs and of replacement of common portions. The study is conducted in accordance with the standards established by a government regulation, which designates among other things the professional orders whose members are authorized to conduct such studies and determines the intervals at which a new study must be obtained by the board of directors.
### Chunk 1019

The standards may vary according to the characteristics of an immovable. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 234 of 556 ### Page 235 Not in force The sums to be paid into the contingency fund are fixed on the basis of the recommendations made in the contingency fund study and taking into account ongoing developments in the coownership, in particular the amounts available in the contingency fund. Not in force Until the developer obtains the contingency fund study, the sums to be paid into the fund must correspond to 0.
### Chunk 1020

5% of the reconstruction cost of the immovable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1071; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, ss. 39 and 155; 2024, c. 2, s. 2. 1071. 1. The syndicate establishes a selfinsurance fund which is liquid and available on short notice. The syndicate is the owner of the fund. The selfinsurance fund is to be used to pay the deductibles provided for by the insurance taken out by the syndicate. It is also to be used to make reparation for injury caused to property in which the syndicate has an insurable interest, where the contingency fund or an insurance indemnity cannot provide for such reparation.
### Chunk 1021

The selfinsurance fund is established on the basis of those deductibles and a reasonable additional amount to provide for the other payments for which the fund is to be used. 2018, c. 23, s. 639. 1072. Each year, the board of directors, after consultation with the general meeting of the coowners, fixes their contribution for common expenses, after determining the sums required to meet the expenses arising from the coownership and the operation of the immovable, and the amounts to be paid into the contingency fund and the selfinsurance fund.
### Chunk 1022

The Government determines, by regulation, the terms according to which the coowners’ minimum contribution to the selfinsurance fund is determined. The contribution of the coowners to the contingency fund is at least 5% of their contribution for common expenses. In fixing the contribution, the rights of any coowner in the common portions for restricted use may be taken into account. The syndicate, without delay, notifies each coowner of the amount of his contribution and the date when it is payable.
### Chunk 1023

In a case where the faults or defects affect the private portions, the syndicate may not proceed until it has obtained the authorization of the coowners of those portions.

At the termination of superficies, the subsoil owner acquires by accession ownership of the constructions, works or plantations by paying their value to the superficiary.
### Chunk 1069

If, however, the constructions, works or plantations are equal in value to the subsoil or of greater value, the superficiary has a right to acquire ownership of the subsoil by paying its value to the subsoil owner, unless he prefers to remove, at his own expense, the constructions, works and plantations he has made and return the subsoil to its former condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 1116. 1117. Where the superficiary fails to exercise his right to acquire ownership of the subsoil within 90 days from the end of the superficies, the owner of the subsoil retains ownership of the constructions, works and plantations.
### Chunk 1070

1991, c. 64, a. 1117. 1118. A subsoil owner and a superficiary who do not agree on the price and other terms and conditions of acquisition of the subsoil or of the constructions, works or plantations may apply to have the court fix the price and the terms and conditions of acquisition. The judgment is equivalent to a valid title and has all the effects thereof. They may also, if they fail to agree on the terms and conditions of removal of the constructions, works or plantations, apply to have the court determine them.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 245 of 556 ### Page 246 TITLE FOUR DISMEMBERMENTS OF THE RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP GENERAL PROVISION 1119. Usufruct, use, servitude and emphyteusis are dismemberments of the right of ownership and are real rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1119. CHAPTER I USUFRUCT DIVISION I NATURE OF USUFRUCT 1120. Usufruct is the right of use and enjoyment, for a certain time, of property owned by another, as one’s own, subject to the obligation of preserving its substance.
### Chunk 1072

1991, c. 64, a. 1120; I. N. 20140501. 1121. Usufruct is established by contract, by will or by law; it may also be established by judgment in the cases prescribed by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1121. 1122. Usufruct may be established for the benefit of one or several usufructuaries jointly or successively. Only a person who exists when the usufruct in his favour opens may be a usufructuary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1122. 1123. No usufruct may last longer than 100 years even if the act granting it provides a longer term or creates a successive usufruct.
### Chunk 1073

Usufruct granted without a term is granted for life or, if the usufructuary is a legal person, for 30 years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1123. DIVISION II RIGHTS OF THE USUFRUCTUARY § 1. — Scope of the usufruct 1124. The usufructuary has the use and enjoyment of the property subject to usufruct; he takes the property in the condition in which he finds it. Usufruct bears on all accessories and on everything that is naturally united to or incorporated with the immovable by accession. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1074

64, a. 1124; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 246 of 556 ### Page 247 1125. The usufructuary may require the bare owner to cease any act which prevents him from fully exercising his right. The bare owner’s alienation of his right does not affect the right of the usufructuary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1125. 1126. The usufructuary appropriates the fruits and revenues produced by the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1126. 1127.
### Chunk 1075

The usufructuary may dispose, as though he were its owner, of all the property under his usufruct which cannot be used without being consumed, subject to the obligation of returning similar property in the same quantity and of the same quality at the end of the usufruct. Where the usufructuary is unable to return similar property he shall pay the value thereof in cash. 1991, c. 64, a. 1127. 1128. The usufructuary may dispose, as a prudent and diligent administrator, of property which, though not consumable, rapidly deteriorates with use.
### Chunk 1076

In the case described in the first paragraph, the usufructuary shall, at the end of the usufruct, return the value of the property at the time he disposed of it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1128. 1129. The usufructuary is entitled to the fruits attached to the property at the beginning of the usufruct. He has no right to the fruits still attached to it at the time his usufruct ceases. An indemnity is due by the bare owner or by the usufructuary, as the case may be, to the person who has done the work, or incurred the expenses, necessary for the production of the fruits.
### Chunk 1077

1991, c. 64, a. 1129; I. N. 20140501. 1130. Revenues are counted, between the usufructuary and the bare owner, day by day. They belong to the usufructuary from the day his right begins to the day it terminates, regardless of when they are payable or paid, except dividends, which belong to the usufructuary only if they are declared during the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1130; I. N. 20140501. 1131. Extraordinary gains derived from ownership of the property subject to usufruct, such as premiums granted upon the redemption of securities, are paid to the usufructuary, who is accountable for them to the bare owner at the end of the usufruct.
### Chunk 1078

1991, c. 64, a. 1131; I. N. 20140501. 1132. If a claim subject to a usufruct becomes payable during the usufruct, it is paid to the usufructuary, who gives an acquittance for it. The usufructuary is accountable for it to the bare owner at the end of the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1132; I. N. 20140501. 1133. The right to increase the capital subject to the usufruct, such as the right to subscribe for securities, belongs to the bare owner, but the right of the usufructuary extends to the increase.
### Chunk 1079

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 247 of 556 ### Page 248 Where the bare owner elects to alienate his right, the proceeds of the alienation are remitted to the usufructuary, who is accountable for them at the end of the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1133; I. N. 20140501. 1134. Voting rights attached to shares or to other securities, to an undivided share, to a fraction of property held in coownership or to any other property belong to the usufructuary.
### Chunk 1080

However, any vote having the effect of altering the substance of the principal property, such as share capital or property held in coownership, or of changing the destination of the property or terminating the legal person, enterprise or group concerned belongs to the bare owner. The allocation of the exercise of voting rights may not be set up against third persons; it is discussed only between the usufructuary and the bare owner. 1991, c. 64, a. 1134; I. N. 20140501. 1135. The usufructuary may transfer his right or lease property included in the usufruct.
### Chunk 1081

1991, c. 64, a. 1135; I. N. 20140501. 1136. A creditor of the usufructuary may cause the rights of the usufructuary to be seized and sold, subject to the rights of the bare owner. A creditor of the bare owner may also cause the rights of the bare owner to be seized and sold, subject to the rights of the usufructuary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1136. § 2. — Disbursements 1137. Necessary disbursements made by the usufructuary are treated, in relation to the bare owner, as those made by a possessor in good faith.
### Chunk 1082

1991, c. 64, a. 1137. 1138. The useful disbursements made by the usufructuary are retained by the bare owner without indemnity at the end of the usufruct, unless the usufructuary elects to remove them and restore the property to its original condition. However, the bare owner may not compel the usufructuary to remove them. 1991, c. 64, a. 1138; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 145. § 3. — Trees and minerals 1139. In no case may the usufructuary fell trees growing on the land subject to the usufruct except for repairs, maintenance or exploitation of the land.
### Chunk 1083

He may, however, dispose of those which have fallen or died naturally. The usufructuary replaces the trees that have been destroyed, in conformity with the usage of the place or the custom of the owners. He also replaces orchard and sugar bush trees, unless most of them have been destroyed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1139. 1140. The usufructuary may begin agricultural or sylvicultural operations if the land subject to the usufruct is suitable therefor. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 248 of 556 ### Page 249 Where the usufructuary begins or continues operations, he shall do so in such a manner as not to exhaust the soil or prevent the regrowth of the forest.
### Chunk 1084

He shall also, in the case of sylvicultural operations, have his operating plan approved by the bare owner before his operations begin. If he fails to obtain such approval, he may have the plan approved by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 1140. 1141. No usufructuary may extract minerals from the land subject to the usufruct except for the repair and maintenance of the land. However, where the extraction of minerals constituted a source of income for the owner before the opening of the usufruct, the usufructuary may continue the extraction in the same way as it was begun.
### Chunk 1085

1991, c. 64, a. 1141. DIVISION III OBLIGATIONS OF THE USUFRUCTUARY § 1. — Inventory and security 1142. The usufructuary, in the manner of an administrator of the property of others, makes an inventory of the property subject to his right unless the person constituting the usufruct has done so himself or has exempted him from doing so. No exemption may be granted if the usufruct is successive. The usufructuary makes the inventory at his own expense and furnishes a copy to the bare owner.
### Chunk 1086

1991, c. 64, a. 1142. 1143. In no case may the usufructuary compel the person constituting the usufruct or the bare owner to deliver the property to him until he has made an inventory. 1991, c. 64, a. 1143. 1144. Except in the case of a seller or donor who has reserved the usufruct, the usufructuary shall, within 60 days from the opening of the usufruct, take out insurance or furnish other security to the bare owner to guarantee performance of his obligations. The usufructuary shall furnish additional security if his obligations increase while the usufruct lasts.
### Chunk 1087

The usufructuary is exempted from these obligations if he is unable to perform them or if the person constituting the usufruct so provides. 1991, c. 64, a. 1144; I. N. 20140501. 1145. If the usufructuary fails to furnish security within the allotted time, the bare owner may have the property sequestrated. The sequestrator, in the manner of an administrator of the property of others charged with simple administration, invests the amounts included in the usufruct and the proceeds of the sale of perishable property.
### Chunk 1088

He similarly invests the amounts deriving from payment of the claims subject to the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1145. 1146. Any unjustified delay by the usufructuary in making an inventory of the property or furnishing security deprives him of his right to the fruits and revenues from the opening of the usufruct until the performance of his obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 1146. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 249 of 556 ### Page 250 1147.
### Chunk 1089

The usufructuary may apply to the court for leave to retain sequestrated movables necessary for his use under no other condition than that he undertake to return them at the end of the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1147; I. N. 20151101. § 2. — Insurance and repairs 1148. The usufructuary is bound to insure the property against ordinary risks such as fire and theft and to pay the insurance premiums while the usufruct lasts. He is, however, exempt from that obligation where the insurance premium is too high in relation to the risks.
### Chunk 1090

1991, c. 64, a. 1148. 1149. In the case of a loss, the indemnity is paid to the usufructuary, who gives an acquittance therefor to the insurer. The usufructuary is bound to use the indemnity for the repair of the property, except in the case of total loss, where he may have enjoyment of the indemnity. 1991, c. 64, a. 1149. 1150. The usufructuary or the bare owner may take out insurance on his own account to secure his rights. The indemnity belongs to the usufructuary or the bare owner, as the case may be.
### Chunk 1091

1991, c. 64, a. 1150. 1151. Maintenance of the property is the responsibility of the usufructuary. He is not bound to make major repairs, unless they result from his act or omission, in particular his failure to carry out maintenance repairs since the opening of the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1151; I. N. 20140501. 1152. Major repairs are those which affect a substantial part of the property and require extraordinary outlays, such as repairs relating to beams and support walls, to the replacement of roofs, to retaining walls or to heating, electrical, plumbing or electronic systems, and, with respect to movables, to motive parts or the casing of the property.
### Chunk 1092

1991, c. 64, a. 1152; I. N. 20140501. 1153. The usufructuary shall notify the bare owner that major repairs are necessary. The bare owner is not bound to make the major repairs. If he makes them, the usufructuary suffers the resulting inconvenience. If he does not make them, the usufructuary may make them and be reimbursed for the cost at the end of the usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1153; I. N. 20140501. § 3. — Other charges 1154. The usufructuary is liable, in proportion to the duration of the usufruct, for ordinary charges against the property subject to his right and for the other charges that are ordinarily paid with the revenues.
### Chunk 1093

The usufructuary is similarly liable for extraordinary charges that are payable in periodic instalments over several years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1154; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 250 of 556 ### Page 251 1155. If a usufructuary by particular title is forced to pay a debt of the succession in order to retain the property subject to his right, he may require immediate reimbursement from the debtor or reimbursement from the bare owner at the end of the usufruct.
### Chunk 1094

1991, c. 64, a. 1155; 2016, c. 4, s. 146. 1156. The usufructuary by general title and the bare owner are bound to pay the debts of the succession in proportion to their shares in the succession. The bare owner is liable for the capital and the usufructuary for the interest. 1991, c. 64, a. 1156; I. N. 20140501. 1157. The usufructuary by general title may pay the debts of the succession; the bare owner is accountable therefor to him at the end of the usufruct. Where the usufructuary elects not to pay the debts of the succession, the bare owner may cause the sale of property subject to the usufruct, up to the amount of the debts, or pay the debts himself; in the latter case, the usufructuary pays interest to the bare owner on the amount paid, for the duration of the usufruct.
### Chunk 1095

1991, c. 64, a. 1157; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1158. The usufructuary is liable for the legal costs of any judicial applications related to his right of usufruct. Where applications relate to both the rights of the bare owner and those of the usufructuary, the rules governing payment of the debts of the succession between the usufructuary by general title and the bare owner apply unless the usufruct is terminated by the judgment, in which case the legal costs are divided equally between the usufructuary and the bare owner.
### Chunk 1096

1991, c. 64, a. 1158; I. N. 20151101; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 147. 1159. If, during the usufruct, a third person encroaches on the property or otherwise infringes the rights of the bare owner, the usufructuary shall notify the bare owner, failing which he is liable for all resulting damage, as if he himself had committed waste. 1991, c. 64, a. 1159; I. N. 20140501. 1160. Neither the bare owner nor the usufructuary is bound to replace anything that has fallen into decay.
### Chunk 1097

A usufructuary exempted from insuring the property is not bound to replace or pay the value of any property that perishes by superior force. 1991, c. 64, a. 1160; I. N. 20140501. 1161. If a usufruct is established upon a herd or a flock and the entire herd or flock perishes by superior force, the usufructuary exempted from insuring the herd or flock is bound to account to the owner for the skins or their value. If the herd or flock does not perish entirely, the usufructuary is bound to replace those animals which have perished, up to the number of the increase.
### Chunk 1098

1991, c. 64, a. 1161; 2015, c. 35, s. 6. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 251 of 556 ### Page 252 DIVISION IV EXTINCTION OF USUFRUCT 1162. Usufruct is extinguished (1) by the expiry of the term; (2) by the death of the usufructuary or the dissolution of the legal person; (3) by the union of the qualities of usufructuary and bare owner in the same person, subject to the rights of third persons; (4) by the forfeiture or renunciation of the right or its conversion into an annuity; (5) by nonuse for 10 years.
### Chunk 1099

1991, c. 64, a. 1162. 1163. Usufruct is also extinguished by the total loss of the property on which it is established, unless the property is insured by the usufructuary. In case of partial loss of the property, the usufruct subsists upon the remainder. 1991, c. 64, a. 1163; I. N. 20140501. 1164. Usufruct is not extinguished by expropriation of the property on which it is established. The indemnity is remitted to the usufructuary under the condition of his rendering account of it at the end of the usufruct.
### Chunk 1100

1991, c. 64, a. 1164. 1165. If a usufruct is granted until a third person reaches a certain age, it continues until the date he would have reached that age, even if he has died. 1991, c. 64, a. 1165. 1166. A usufruct created for the benefit of several successive usufructuaries is extinguished with the death of the last usufructuary or the dissolution of the last legal person. The extinction of the right of one of the usufructuaries in a joint usufruct benefits the bare owner.
### Chunk 1101

1991, c. 64, a. 1166; I. N. 20140501. 1167. At the end of the usufruct, the usufructuary returns the property subject to the usufruct to the bare owner in the condition in which it is at that time. The usufructuary is liable for any loss due to his fault or not resulting from normal use of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1167; I. N. 20140501. 1168. A usufructuary who abuses his enjoyment, commits waste on the property, allows it to decline or in any manner endangers the rights of the bare owner may forfeit his right.
### Chunk 1102

The court may, according to the gravity of the circumstances, pronounce the absolute extinction of the usufruct, with an indemnity payable immediately or by instalments to the bare owner, or without indemnity. It may also declare the usufructuary’s right forfeited in favour of a joint or successive usufructuary, or it may impose conditions for the continuance of the usufruct. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 252 of 556 ### Page 253 The creditors of the usufructuary may intervene in the proceedings to ensure the preservation of their rights; they may offer to repair the waste and provide security for the future.
### Chunk 1103

1991, c. 64, a. 1168; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 148. 1169. A usufructuary may renounce his right, in whole or in part. Where part only of the right is renounced and failing an agreement, the court fixes the new obligations of the usufructuary, taking into account, in particular, the scope and duration of the right, and the fruits and revenues derived therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 1169. 1170. Total renunciation may be set up against the bare owner from the day he is served notice of it; partial renunciation may be set up from the date of judicial applications or of an agreement between the parties.
### Chunk 1104

1991, c. 64, a. 1170; I. N. 20151101. 1171. A usufructuary having serious difficulty in performing his obligations is entitled to require the bare owner or joint or successive usufructuary to convert his right to an annuity. Failing agreement, the court, if it confirms the right of the usufructuary, fixes the annuity, taking into account, in particular, the scope and duration of the right and the fruits and revenues derived from it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1171. CHAPTER II USE 1172.
### Chunk 1105

A right of use is the right to temporarily use the property of another and to take the fruits and revenues thereof, to the extent of the needs of the user and the persons living with him or his dependants. 1991, c. 64, a. 1172; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 149. 1173. The right of use may not be assigned or seized unless the agreement or the act establishing the right of use provides otherwise. If the agreement or act is silent as to whether the right may be assigned or seized, the court may, in the interest of the user and after ascertaining that the owner suffers no injury, authorize the assignment or seizure of the right.
### Chunk 1106

1991, c. 64, a. 1173; I. N. 20140501. 1174. A user whose right bears on only part of a property may use any facility intended for common use. 1991, c. 64, a. 1174. 1175. A user who takes all the fruits and revenues of the property or who uses the property in its entirety is liable, for the whole, for the costs he incurred to produce them, for the maintenance repairs and for the payment of the charges, in the same manner as a usufructuary. Where the user takes only part of the fruits and revenues or uses only part of the property, he contributes in proportion to his use.
### Chunk 1107

1991, c. 64, a. 1175; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 253 of 556 ### Page 254 1176. The provisions governing usufruct, adapted as required, are, in all other respects, applicable to the right of use. However, the rules relating to conversion of the usufruct into an annuity do not apply to the right of use unless that right may be assigned and seized. 1991, c. 64, a. 1176. CHAPTER III SERVITUDES DIVISION I NATURE OF SERVITUDES 1177.
### Chunk 1108

A servitude is a charge imposed on an immovable, the servient land, in favour of another immovable, the dominant land, belonging to a different owner. Under the charge the owner of the servient land is required to tolerate certain acts of use by the owner of the dominant land or himself abstain from exercising certain rights inherent in ownership. A servitude extends to all that is necessary for its exercise. 1991, c. 64, a. 1177. 1178. An obligation to do something may be attached to a servitude and imposed on the owner of the servient land.
### Chunk 1109

The obligation is an accessory to the servitude and can only be stipulated for the service or exploitation of the immovable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1178; I. N. 20140501. 1179. Servitudes are either continuous or discontinuous. Continuous servitudes, such as servitudes of view or of nonconstruction, are those the exercise of which does not require the actual intervention of the holder. Discontinuous servitudes, such as pedestrian or vehicular rights of way, are those the exercise of which requires the actual intervention of the holder.
### Chunk 1110

1991, c. 64, a. 1179; I. N. 20140501. 1180. Servitudes are either apparent or unapparent. A servitude is apparent if it is manifested by an external sign; otherwise it is unapparent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1180. 1181. A servitude is established by contract, by will, by destination of the owner or by operation of law. It may not be established without title, and possession, even immemorial, is insufficient for this purpose. 1991, c. 64, a. 1181; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 254 of 556 ### Page 255 1182.
### Chunk 1111

Servitudes are not affected by the transfer of ownership of the servient or dominant land. They remain attached to the immovables through changes of ownership, subject to the provisions relating to the publication of rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1182. 1183. Servitude by destination of the owner is evidenced in writing by the owner of the land who, in contemplation of its future parcelling, immediately establishes the nature, scope and situation of the servitude on one part of the land in favour of other parts.
### Chunk 1112

1991, c. 64, a. 1183; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II EXERCISE OF SERVITUDES 1184. The owner of the dominant land may, at his own expense, take the measures or make all the works necessary for the exercise and preservation of the servitude unless otherwise stipulated in the act establishing the servitude. At the end of the servitude he shall, at the request of the owner of the servient land, restore the place to its former condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 1184. 1185. The owner of the servient land, charged by the title with making the necessary works for the exercise and preservation of the servitude, may free himself of the charge by abandoning the entire servient land or any part of it sufficient for the exercise of the servitude to the owner of the dominant land.
### Chunk 1113

1991, c. 64, a. 1185. 1186. In no case may the owner of the dominant land make any change that would aggravate the situation of the servient land. In no case may the owner of the servient land do anything that would tend to diminish the exercise of the servitude or to render it less convenient. However, he may, at his own expense, provided he has an interest in doing so, transfer the site of the servitude to another place where its exercise will be no less convenient to the owner of the dominant land.
### Chunk 1114

1991, c. 64, a. 1186. 1187. If the dominant land is divided, the servitude remains due for each portion, but the situation of the servient land may not thereby be aggravated. Thus, in the case of a right of way, all owners of lots resulting from the division of the dominant land shall exercise it over the same place. 1991, c. 64, a. 1187. 1188. Division of the servient land does not affect the rights of the owner of the dominant land. 1991, c. 64, a. 1188. 1189. Except in the case of land enclosed by that of others, a servitude of right of way may be redeemed where its usefulness to the dominant land is out of proportion to the inconvenience or depreciation it entails for the servient land.

The parties may, in writing, exclude the possibility of redeeming a servitude for a period of not over 30 years.
### Chunk 1116

1991, c. 64, a. 1190. DIVISION III EXTINCTION OF SERVITUDES 1191. A servitude is extinguished (1) by the union of the qualities of owner of the servient land and owner of the dominant land in the same person; (2) by the express renunciation of the owner of the dominant land; (3) by the expiry of the term for which it was established; (4) by redemption; (5) by nonuse for 10 years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1191. 1192. In the case of discontinuous servitudes, prescription begins to run from the day the owner of the dominant land ceases to exercise the servitude and, in the case of continuous servitudes, from the day any act contrary to their exercise is done.
### Chunk 1117

1991, c. 64, a. 1192; I. N. 20140501. 1193. The mode of exercising a servitude may be prescribed just as the servitude itself, and in the same manner. 1991, c. 64, a. 1193. 1194. Prescription runs even where the dominant land or the servient land undergoes a change of such a kind as to render exercise of the servitude impossible. 1991, c. 64, a. 1194. CHAPTER IV EMPHYTEUSIS DIVISION I NATURE OF EMPHYTEUSIS 1195. Emphyteusis is the right which, for a certain time, grants a person the full benefit and use of an immovable owned by another provided he does not endanger its existence and undertakes to make constructions, works or plantations thereon that increase its value in a lasting manner.
### Chunk 1118

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 256 of 556 ### Page 257 Emphyteusis is established by contract or by will. 1991, c. 64, a. 1195; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 150. 1196. Emphyteusis both on land and an existing building may be the subject of a declaration of co emphyteusis, which is governed by the same rules as those provided for a declaration of coownership. It is also subject to the rules, adapted as required, applicable to coownership established on a building built by an emphyteuta.
### Chunk 1119

1991, c. 64, a. 1196; I. N. 20140501. 1197. The term of the emphyteusis shall be stipulated in the constituting act and shall be not less than 10 nor more than 100 years. If it is longer, it is reduced to 100 years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1197; I. N. 20140501. 1198. Emphyteusis on land on which a building held in coownership is built, or both on land and an existing building, may be renewed without the emphyteuta being required to make new constructions or plantations or new works, other than useful disbursements.
### Chunk 1120

1991, c. 64, a. 1198; I. N. 20140501. 1199. The creditor of the emphyteuta may cause the latter’s rights to be seized and sold, subject to the rights of the owner of the immovable. The creditor of the owner may also cause the latter’s rights to be seized and sold, subject to the rights of the emphyteuta. 1991, c. 64, a. 1199; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE EMPHYTEUTA AND OF THE OWNER 1991, c. 64, sec. II; I. N. 20140501. 1200. The emphyteuta has all the rights in the immovable attaching to the quality of owner, subject to the restrictions contained in this chapter and in the act constituting emphyteusis.
### Chunk 1121

The constituting act may limit the exercise of the rights of the parties, particularly by granting rights or guarantees to the owner for protecting the value of the immovable, ensuring its conservation, yield or utility or by otherwise preserving the rights of the owner or of the emphyteuta or regulating the performance of the obligations established in the constituting act. 1991, c. 64, a. 1200; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 151. 1201. The emphyteuta, at his own expense, and after convening the owner, causes a statement of the immovables subject to his right to be drawn up, unless the owner has exempted him therefrom.
### Chunk 1122

1991, c. 64, a. 1201; I. N. 20140501. 1202. The emphyteuta is liable for partial loss of the immovable; he remains liable in such a case for full payment of the price stipulated in the constituting act. 1991, c. 64, a. 1202; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 257 of 556 ### Page 258 1203. The emphyteuta is bound to make repairs, even major repairs, concerning the immovable or the constructions, works or plantations made in the performance of his obligation.
### Chunk 1123

1991, c. 64, a. 1203; I. N. 20140501. 1204. If an emphyteuta commits waste on the immovable, allows it to decline or in any manner endangers the rights of the owner, the emphyteuta may forfeit his right. The court, according to the gravity of the circumstances, may resiliate the emphyteusis with an indemnity payable immediately or by instalments to the owner, or without indemnity, or it may require the emphyteuta to furnish other security or impose any other obligations or conditions on him.
### Chunk 1124

The creditors of the emphyteuta may intervene in the proceedings to preserve their rights; they may offer to repair the waste and give security for the future. 1991, c. 64, a. 1204; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1205. The emphyteuta is liable for all property charges against the immovable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1205; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 152. 1206. The owner has the same obligations towards the emphyteuta as a seller. 1991, c. 64, a. 1206; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1125

1207. Where a price payable in a lump sum or by instalments is fixed in the constituting act and the emphyteuta fails to pay it for three years, the owner is entitled, after at least 90 days’ notice, to apply for resiliation of the constituting act. Resiliation may not be applied for where divided coownership is established on a building built by the emphyteuta. The same applies where the immovable is the subject of a declaration of coemphyteusis. 1991, c. 64, a. 1207; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1126

DIVISION III TERMINATION OF EMPHYTEUSIS 1208. Emphyteusis is terminated (1) by the expiry of the term stipulated in the constituting act; (2) by the total loss or expropriation of the immovable; (3) by the resiliation of the constituting act; (4) by the union of the qualities of owner and emphyteuta in the same person; (5) by nonuser for 10 years; (6) by abandonment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1208; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 258 of 556 ### Page 259 1209.
### Chunk 1127

Upon termination of the emphyteusis, the owner recovers the immovable free of all the rights and charges granted by the emphyteuta, unless the termination of the emphyteusis results from resiliation by agreement or from the union of the qualities of owner and emphyteuta in the same person. 1991, c. 64, a. 1209; I. N. 20140501. 1210. Upon termination of the emphyteusis, the emphyteuta shall return the immovable in a good state of repair with the constructions, works or plantations stipulated in the constituting act, unless they have perished by superior force.
### Chunk 1128

Any additions made to the immovable by the emphyteuta which he is under no obligation to make are treated as disbursements made by a possessor in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 1210; I. N. 20140501. 1211. Unless the emphyteuta has renounced his right, emphyteusis may also be terminated by abandonment, which may take place only if the emphyteuta has fulfilled all his past obligations and leaves the immovable free of all charges. 1991, c. 64, a. 1211; I. N. 20140501. TITLE FIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PROPERTY CHAPTER I STIPULATIONS OF INALIENABILITY 1212.
### Chunk 1129

A restriction on the exercise of the right to dispose of property may only be stipulated by gift or will. A stipulation of inalienability is made in writing at the time of transfer of ownership of the property or a dismemberment of the right of ownership in it to a person or to a trust. The stipulation of inalienability is valid only if it is temporary and justified by a serious and legitimate interest. Nevertheless, it may be valid for the duration of a substitution or trust. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1130

64, a. 1212; I. N. 20140501. 1213. A person whose property is inalienable may be authorized by the court to dispose of the property if the interest that had justified the stipulation of inalienability has disappeared or where a greater interest comes to require it. The court may, where it authorizes alienation of the property, fix any conditions it considers necessary to safeguard the interests of the person who stipulated inalienability, his successors or the person for whose benefit inalienability was stipulated.
### Chunk 1131

1991, c. 64, a. 1213. 1214. A stipulation of inalienability may not be set up against third persons unless it is published in the appropriate register. 1991, c. 64, a. 1214; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 259 of 556 ### Page 260 1215. A stipulation of inalienability of property renders the property unseizable for any debt contracted before or during the period of inalienability by the person who receives the property, subject, in particular, to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 1132

01). 1991, c. 64, a. 1215; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 153. 1216. Any clause tending to prevent a person whose property is inalienable from contesting the validity of the stipulation of inalienability or from applying for authorization to alienate the property is deemed unwritten. Any penal clause to the same effect is also deemed unwritten. 1991, c. 64, a. 1216; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20151101. 1217. The nullity of an alienation made notwithstanding a stipulation of inalienability and without the authorization of the court may not be invoked by anyone except the person who made the stipulation and his successors or the person for whose benefit the stipulation was made.
### Chunk 1133

1991, c. 64, a. 1217. CHAPTER II SUBSTITUTION DIVISION I NATURE AND SCOPE OF SUBSTITUTION 1218. Substitution exists where a person receives property by a liberality with the obligation of handing it over to a third person after a certain period. Substitution is established by gift or by will; it shall be evidenced in writing and published at the registry office. 1991, c. 64, a. 1218; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1219. The person who has the obligation to hand over is called the institute and the person who is entitled to take after him is called the substitute.
### Chunk 1134

A substitute who takes with the obligation to hand over becomes in turn the institute with respect to the subsequent substitute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1219; I. N. 20140501. 1220. A prohibition against disposing of the property by will, placed on the donee or legatee without further indication, entails substitution in favour of the intestate heirs of the donee or legatee with respect to the property given or bequeathed and remaining at his death. 1991, c. 64, a. 1220; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c.
### Chunk 1135

4, s. 154. 1221. A substitution may not extend to more than two successive ranks of persons, in addition to that of the initial institute, and is without effect for subsequent ranks. Accretion between coinstitutes upon the death of one of them, where it is stipulated that his share passes to the surviving institutes, is not considered to be made to a subsequent rank. 1991, c. 64, a. 1221; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 260 of 556 ### Page 261 1222.
### Chunk 1136

The rules on successions, particularly those relating to the right of option or to testamentary provisions, adapted as required, apply to a substitution from the time it opens, whether it was created by gift or by will. 1991, c. 64, a. 1222; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II SUBSTITUTIONS BEFORE OPENING § 1. — Rights and obligations of the institute 1223. Before the opening of a substitution, the institute is the owner of the substituted property, which forms, within his personal patrimony, a separate patrimony intended for the substitute.
### Chunk 1137

1991, c. 64, a. 1223. 1224. Within two months after the gift or after acceptance of the legacy, the institute, in the manner of an administrator of the property of others, shall make an inventory of the property at his own expense, after convening the substitute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1224. 1225. The institute, in exercising his rights and performing his obligations, shall act with prudence and diligence, having regard to the rights of the substitute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1225; I.
### Chunk 1138

N. 20140501. 1226. The institute shall perform all acts necessary to maintain and preserve the property. He pays the charges and debts of all kinds that became due before the opening; he collects the claims, gives acquittance therefor and exercises all judicial recourses relating to the substituted property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1226. 1227. The institute shall insure the property against ordinary risks such as fire and theft. He is, however, dispensed from that obligation if the insurance premium is too high in relation to the risks.
### Chunk 1139

The insurance indemnity becomes substituted property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1227. 1228. The right of an institute to begin or continue agricultural, sylvicultural or mining operations on substituted land is governed by the rules on usufruct. 1991, c. 64, a. 1228. 1229. An institute may alienate the substituted property by onerous title or lease it. He may also charge it with a hypothec if that is required for its maintenance and preservation or to make an investment in the name of the substitution.
### Chunk 1140

The rights of the acquirer, creditor or lessee are unaffected by the rights of the substitute at the opening of the substitution. 1991, c. 64, a. 1229; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 261 of 556 ### Page 262 1230. The institute is bound to reinvest, in the name of the substitution, the proceeds of any alienation of substituted property and the capital paid to him before the opening or received by him from the grantor, in accordance with the provisions relating to investments presumed sound.
### Chunk 1141

1991, c. 64, a. 1230; I. N. 20140501. 1231. On each anniversary of the date of inventory of the property, the institute shall inform the substitute of any change in the general mass of the property; he shall also inform him of the reinvestment he has made of the proceeds of alienation of property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1231. 1232. If the act constituting the substitution provides therefor, the institute may dispose of the substituted property gratuitously or not reinvest the proceeds of its alienation; he has no right to bequeath it unless that is expressly permitted by the act.
### Chunk 1142

In such cases, the substitution has effect only as regards the property that was not disposed of by the institute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1232; I. N. 20140501. 1233. Creditors holding a prior claim or a hypothec on substituted property have, with respect to that property, the rights and remedies conferred on them by law. The other creditors may cause substituted property to be seized and sold by sale under judicial authority, after discussion of the personal patrimony of the institute.
### Chunk 1143

The substitute may oppose the seizure and demand that the seizure and sale be limited to the rights conferred on the institute by the substitution. Failing opposition, the sale is valid; the successful bidder has a good title and the right of action of the substitute is exercisable only against the institute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1233; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 1234. The institute may, before the substitution opens, renounce his rights in favour of the substitute and hand over the substituted property to him in advance.
### Chunk 1144

The renunciation by the institute may not prejudice the rights of his creditors or the rights of the eventual substitute. 1991, c. 64, a. 1234; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Rights of the substitute 1235. Before the substitution opens, the substitute has an eventual right to the property substituted; he may dispose of or renounce his right and perform any conservatory act to ensure the protection of his right. 1991, c. 64, a. 1235; I. N. 20140501. 1236. Where the institute refuses or fails to make an inventory of the property within the required time, the substitute may do so at the expense of the institute.
### Chunk 1145

He first convenes the institute and the other interested persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 1236. 1237. The institute shall, if the act creating the substitution so requires or if ordered by the court upon the application of the substitute or any interested person who establishes that such a measure is necessary, take out insurance or furnish other security to guarantee the performance of his obligations. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 262 of 556 ### Page 263 He shall also furnish additional security where his obligations are increased before the opening of the substitution.
### Chunk 1146

1991, c. 64, a. 1237; I. N. 20140501. 1238. If the institute fails to perform his obligations or acts in a manner that endangers the rights of the substitute, the court may, depending on the gravity of the circumstances, deprive him of fruits and revenues, require him to restore the capital, declare his rights forfeited in favour of the substitute or appoint a sequestrator chosen preferably from the substitutes. 1991, c. 64, a. 1238. 1239. The rights of a substitute who is not yet conceived are exercised by the person designated by the grantor to act as curator to the substitution and who accepts the office or, failing designation or acceptance, by the person appointed by the court on the application of the institute or any interested person.
### Chunk 1147

The Public Curator may be designated to act. 1991, c. 64, a. 1239; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III OPENING OF THE SUBSTITUTION 1240. Unless an earlier time has been fixed by the grantor, the opening of the substitution takes place on the death of the institute. Where the institute is a legal person, the substitution may not open more than 30 years after the gift or the opening of the succession, or after the day its right arises. 1991, c. 64, a. 1240. 1241. Where it is stipulated that the share of an institute passes, on his death, to the surviving institutes of the same rank, the opening of the substitution takes place only on the death of the last institute.
### Chunk 1148

However, an opening so deferred may not prejudice the rights of the substitute who would have received on the death of an institute but for the stipulation; the right to receive is vested in the substitute but its exercise is suspended until the substitution opens. 1991, c. 64, a. 1241; I. N. 20140501. 1242. Only a person having the required qualities to receive by gift or by will at the time the substitution opens may be a substitute. Where there are several substitutes of the same rank, only one need have the required qualities to receive at the time his right arises to protect the right of all the other substitutes to receive, if they subsequently accept the substitution.
### Chunk 1149

1991, c. 64, a. 1242. DIVISION IV SUBSTITUTION AFTER OPENING 1243. The substitute who accepts the substitution receives the property directly from the grantor and is, by the opening, seised of ownership of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1243. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 263 of 556 ### Page 264 1244. The institute shall, at the opening, render account to the substitute and hand over the substituted property to him. Where the substituted property is no longer in kind, the institute hands over whatever has been acquired through reinvestment or, failing that, the value of the property at the time of the alienation.
### Chunk 1150

1991, c. 64, a. 1244; I. N. 20140501. 1245. The institute hands over the property in the condition it is in at the opening of the substitution. The institute is liable for any loss caused by his fault or not resulting from normal use. 1991, c. 64, a. 1245; I. N. 20140501. 1246. Where only the residue of the property given or bequeathed is subject to the substitution, the institute hands over only the property remaining and the balance of the proceeds of the alienated property.
### Chunk 1151

1991, c. 64, a. 1246; I. N. 20140501. 1247. The institute is entitled to reimbursement, with interest accrued from the opening, of capital debts that he has paid without having been charged to do so and of expenditures generally debited from the capital that he has incurred by reason of the substitution. The institute is also entitled to reimbursement, in proportion to the duration of his right, of expenditures generally debited from the revenues for any object that exceeds that duration.
### Chunk 1152

1991, c. 64, a. 1247; I. N. 20140501. 1248. The institute is entitled to be reimbursed for the useful disbursements he has made, in accordance with the rules applicable to possessors in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 1248; I. N. 20140501. 1249. The opening of a substitution revives the claims and debts that existed between the institute and the grantor; it terminates the confusion, in the person of the institute, of the qualities of creditor and debtor, except for interest accrued until the opening.
### Chunk 1153

1991, c. 64, a. 1249; I. N. 20140501. 1250. The institute may retain the substituted property until payment of what is due to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 1250. 1251. The heirs of the institute are bound to perform the obligations that this section imposes on the institute, and they have the same rights as it confers on him. The heirs of the institute are bound to continue anything that is a necessary consequence of the acts performed by him or that cannot be deferred without risk of loss.
### Chunk 1154

1991, c. 64, a. 1251; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION V LAPSE AND REVOCATION OF SUBSTITUTION 1252. Lapse of a testamentary substitution with regard to an institute does not give rise to representation; it benefits his coinstitutes or, in the absence of coinstitutes, the substitute. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 264 of 556 ### Page 265 Lapse of a testamentary substitution with regard to a substitute benefits his cosubstitutes, if any; otherwise, it benefits the institute.
### Chunk 1155

1991, c. 64, a. 1252; I. N. 20140501. 1253. The donor may revoke the substitution with regard to the substitute, until the opening, as long as it has not been accepted by or for the substitute. However, with respect to the donor, the substitute is deemed to have accepted where he is the child of the institute or where one of the cosubstitutes has accepted the substitution. 1991, c. 64, a. 1253; I. N. 20140501. 1254. Revocation of a substitution with regard to the institute benefits the coinstitute, if any; otherwise it benefits the substitute; revocation with regard to the substitute benefits the cosubstitute, if any; otherwise it benefits the institute.
### Chunk 1156

1991, c. 64, a. 1254. 1255. The grantor may reserve for himself the right to determine the share of the substitutes or confer that right on the institute. The exercise of the right by the donor does not constitute a revocation of the substitution even if it has the effect of completely excluding a substitute from the benefit of the substitution. 1991, c. 64, a. 1255; I. N. 20140501. TITLE SIX CERTAIN PATRIMONIES BY APPROPRIATION CHAPTER I THE FOUNDATION 1256. A foundation results from an act whereby a person irrevocably appropriates the whole or part of his property to the lasting fulfilment of a socially beneficial purpose.
### Chunk 1157

It may not have the making of profit or the operation of an enterprise as its essential object. 1991, c. 64, a. 1256; 2016, c. 4, s. 155. 1257. The property of the foundation constitutes either an autonomous patrimony distinct from that of the settlor or any other person, or the patrimony of a legal person. In the first case, the foundation is governed by the provisions of this Title relating to a social trust, subject to the provisions of law; in the second case, the foundation is governed by the laws applicable to legal persons of the same kind.
### Chunk 1158

1991, c. 64, a. 1257. 1258. A foundation created by trust is established by gift or by will in accordance with the rules governing those acts. 1991, c. 64, a. 1258. 1259. Unless otherwise provided in the act constituting the foundation, the property forming the initial patrimony of the trust foundation or any property subrogated or added thereto shall be preserved and allow for CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 265 of 556 ### Page 266 the fulfilment of the purpose, either by the distribution only of those revenues that derive therefrom or by a use that does not appreciably alter the substance of the patrimony.

A trust results from an act whereby a person, the settlor, transfers property from his patrimony to another patrimony constituted by him which he appropriates to a particular purpose and which a trustee undertakes, by his acceptance, to hold and administer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1260. 1261. The trust patrimony, consisting of the property transferred in trust, constitutes a patrimony by appropriation, autonomous and distinct from that of the settlor, trustee or beneficiary and in which none of them has any real right.
### Chunk 1160

1991, c. 64, a. 1261. 1262. A trust is established by contract, whether by onerous or gratuitous title, by will or, in certain cases, by law. Where authorized by law, it may also be established by judgment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1262; I. N. 20140501. 1263. A trust established by onerous contract may have as its object the guarantee of the performance of an obligation. In that case, to be set up against third persons, the trust must be published in the register of personal and movable real rights or in the land register, according to the movable or immovable nature of the property transferred in trust.
### Chunk 1161

Upon the default of the settlor, the trustee is governed by the rules regarding the exercise of hypothecary rights set out in the Book on Prior Claims and Hypothecs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1263; 1998, c. 5, s. 1; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 157. 1264. A trust is constituted upon the acceptance of the trustee or of one of the trustees if there are several. In the case of a testamentary trust, the effects of the trustee’s acceptance are retroactive to the day of death. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1162

64, a. 1264. 1265. Acceptance of the trust divests the settlor of the property, charges the trustee with seeing to the appropriation of the property and the administration of the trust patrimony and is sufficient to establish the right of the beneficiary with certainty. 1991, c. 64, a. 1265. DIVISION II VARIOUS KINDS OF TRUSTS AND THEIR DURATION 1266. Trusts are constituted for personal purposes or for purposes of private or social utility. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 266 of 556 ### Page 267 Provided it is designated as a trust, a trust may be identified by the name of the grantor, the trustee or the beneficiary or, in the case of a trust constituted for purposes of private or social utility, by a name which reflects its object.
### Chunk 1163

1991, c. 64, a. 1266. 1267. A personal trust is constituted gratuitously for the purpose of securing a benefit for a determinate or determinable person. 1991, c. 64, a. 1267. 1268. A private trust has as its object the erection, maintenance or preservation of corporeal property or the use of property appropriated to a specific use, whether for the indirect benefit of a person or in his memory, or for some other private purpose. 1991, c. 64, a. 1268; I. N. 20140501; I.
### Chunk 1164

N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 158. 1269. A trust constituted by onerous title for the purpose, in particular, of allowing the making of profit by means of investments, providing for retirement or procuring another benefit for the settlor or for the persons he designates or for the members of a partnership, company or association, or for employees or holders of securities, is also a private trust. 1991, c. 64, a. 1269; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 159. 1270. A social trust is a trust constituted for a purpose of general interest, such as a cultural, educational, philanthropic, religious or scientific purpose.
### Chunk 1165

It does not have the making of profit or the operation of an enterprise as its essential object. 1991, c. 64, a. 1270; 2016, c. 4, s. 160. 1271. A personal trust constituted for the benefit of several persons successively may not include more than two ranks of beneficiaries of the fruits and revenues, in addition to that of the beneficiary of the capital; it is without effect with respect to any subsequent ranks it might contemplate. Accretions of fruits and revenues between cobeneficiaries of the same rank are subject to the rules of substitution relating to accretions between coinstitutes of the same rank.
### Chunk 1166

1991, c. 64, a. 1271; I. N. 20140501. 1272. The right of beneficiaries of the first rank opens not later than 100 years after the trust is constituted, even if a longer term is stipulated. The right of beneficiaries of subsequent ranks may open later but solely for the benefit of those beneficiaries who have the required quality to receive at the expiry of 100 years after the constitution of the trust. In no case may a legal person be a beneficiary for a period exceeding 100 years, even if a longer term is stipulated.

1991, c. 64, a. 1272; I. N. 20140501. 1273. A private or social trust may be perpetual. 1991, c. 64, a. 1273. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 267 of 556 ### Page 268 DIVISION III ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST § 1. — Appointment and office of the trustee 1274. Any natural person having the full exercise of his civil rights, and any legal person authorized by law, may act as a trustee. 1991, c. 64, a. 1274. 1275. The settlor or the beneficiary may be a trustee but he shall act jointly with a trustee who is neither the settlor nor a beneficiary.
### Chunk 1168

1991, c. 64, a. 1275. 1276. The settlor may appoint one or several trustees or provide the mode of their appointment or replacement. 1991, c. 64, a. 1276. 1277. The court may, at the request of an interested person and after notice has been given to the persons it indicates, appoint a trustee where the settlor has failed to do so or where it is impossible to appoint or replace a trustee. The court may appoint one or several other trustees where required by the conditions of the administration.
### Chunk 1169

1991, c. 64, a. 1277. 1278. A trustee has the control and the exclusive administration of the trust patrimony, and the titles relating to the property of which it is composed are drawn up in his name; he has the exercise of all the rights pertaining to the patrimony and may take any proper measure to secure its appropriation. A trustee acts as the administrator of the property of others charged with full administration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1278. § 2. — The beneficiary and his rights 1279.
### Chunk 1170

Only a person having the qualities to receive by gift or by will at the time his right opens may be the beneficiary of a trust constituted gratuitously. Where there are several beneficiaries of the same rank, it is sufficient that one of them have such qualities to preserve the right of the others if they avail themselves of it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1279. 1280. To receive, the beneficiary of a trust shall meet the conditions required by the constituting act. 1991, c. 64, a. 1280. 1281.
### Chunk 1171

The settlor may reserve the right to receive the fruits and revenues or even, where such is the case, the capital of the trust, even a trust constituted by gratuitous title, or to participate in the benefits it procures. 1991, c. 64, a. 1281; I. N. 20140501. 1282. The settlor may reserve for himself the power to appoint the beneficiaries or determine their shares, or confer it on the trustees or a third person. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 268 of 556 ### Page 269 In the case of a social trust, the trustee’s power to appoint the beneficiaries and determine their shares is presumed.
### Chunk 1172

In the case of a personal or private trust, the power to appoint may be exercised by the trustee or the third person only if the class of persons from which he is to appoint the beneficiary is clearly determined in the constituting act. 1991, c. 64, a. 1282; 2016, c. 4, s. 161. 1283. The person having the power to appoint the beneficiaries or determine their shares exercises it as he sees fit. He may change or revoke his decision for the requirements of the trust. The person exercising that power may not do so for his own benefit.
### Chunk 1173

1991, c. 64, a. 1283; I. N. 20140501. 1284. While the trust is in effect, the beneficiary has the right to require, pursuant to the constituting act, either the provision of a benefit granted to him, or the payment of the fruits and revenues and of the capital or the payment of one or the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 1284; I. N. 20140501. 1285. The beneficiary of a trust constituted by gratuitous title is presumed to have accepted the right granted to him and he is entitled to dispose of it.
### Chunk 1174

He may renounce it at any time; he shall then do so by notarial act en minute if he is the beneficiary of a personal or private trust. 1991, c. 64, a. 1285. 1286. If the beneficiary renounces his right, or if his right lapses, it passes, according to whether he is the beneficiary of the fruits and revenues or of the capital, to the cobeneficiaries of the fruits and revenues or of the capital, in proportion to the share of each. If he is the sole beneficiary of the fruits and revenues of his rank, his right passes, in proportion to the share of each, to the beneficiaries of the fruits and revenues of the second rank, or where there are no such beneficiaries, to the beneficiaries of the capital.
### Chunk 1175

1991, c. 64, a. 1286. § 3. — Measures of supervision and control 1287. The administration of a trust is subject to the supervision of the settlor or of his heirs, if he has died, and of the beneficiary, even a future beneficiary. In addition, in cases provided for by law, the administration of a private or social trust is subject, according to its object and purpose, to the supervision of the persons or bodies designated by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1287. 1288. Upon the constitution of a private or social trust subject to the supervision of a person or body designated by law, the trustee shall file with the person or body a statement indicating, in particular, the nature, object and term of the trust and the name and address of the trustee.
### Chunk 1176

The trustee shall, at the request of the person or body, allow the trust records to be examined and furnish any account, report or information requested of him. 1991, c. 64, a. 1288. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 269 of 556 ### Page 270 1289. The rights of the beneficiary of a personal trust, if he is not yet conceived, are exercised by the person who, having been designated by the settlor to act as curator, accepts the office or, failing him, by the person appointed by the court on the application of the trustee or any interested person.
### Chunk 1177

The Public Curator may be designated to act. In a private trust of which no person, even determinable or future, may be a beneficiary, the rights granted to the beneficiary under this subsection may be exercised by the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 1289. 1290. The settlor, the beneficiary or any other interested person may, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, take action against the trustee to compel him to perform his obligations or to perform any act which is necessary in the interest of the trust, to enjoin him to abstain from any action harmful to the trust or to have him removed.
### Chunk 1178

He may also impugn any acts performed by the trustee in fraud of the trust patrimony or the rights of the beneficiary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1290. 1291. The court may authorize the settlor, the beneficiary or any other interested person to take part in judicial proceedings in the place and stead of the trustee when, without sufficient reason, he refuses or neglects to do so or is prevented from doing so. 1991, c. 64, a. 1291; 2016, c. 4, s. 162. 1292. The trustee, the settlor and the beneficiary are solidarily liable for acts in which they participate that are performed in fraud of the rights of the creditors of the settlor or of the trust patrimony.
### Chunk 1179

1991, c. 64, a. 1292. DIVISION IV CHANGES TO THE TRUST AND TO THE PATRIMONY 1293. Any person may increase the trust patrimony by transferring property to it by contract or by will in conformity with the rules applicable to the constitution of a trust. The person does not acquire the rights of a settlor by that fact. The transferred property is mingled with the other property of the trust patrimony and is administered in accordance with the provisions of the constituting act. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1180

64, a. 1293. 1294. Where a trust has ceased to meet the original intent of the settlor, particularly as a result of circumstances unknown to him or unforeseeable and which make the pursuit of the purpose of the trust impossible or too onerous, the court may, on the application of an interested person, terminate the trust; the court may also, in the case of a social trust, substitute, for the original purpose of the trust, a purpose as nearly like it as possible. Where the trust continues to meet the intent of the settlor but new measures would allow a more faithful compliance with his intent or facilitate the fulfilment of the trust, the court may amend the provisions of the constituting act.
### Chunk 1181

1991, c. 64, a. 1294; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 163. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 270 of 556 ### Page 271 1295. Notice of the application shall be given to the settlor and to the trustee and, where such is the case, to the beneficiary, to the liquidator of the succession of the settlor, or his heirs, and to any other person or body designated by law, where the trust is subject to their supervision. 1991, c. 64, a. 1295. DIVISION V TERMINATION OF THE TRUST 1296.
### Chunk 1182

A trust is terminated by the renunciation or lapse of the right of all the beneficiaries, both of the capital and of the fruits and revenues. A trust is also terminated by the expiry of the term or the fulfilment of the condition, by the attainment of the purpose of the trust or by the impossibility, confirmed by the court, of attaining it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1296. 1297. At the termination of a trust, the trustee shall hand over the property to those who are entitled to it. Where there is no beneficiary, any property remaining when the trust is terminated devolves to the settlor or his heirs.
### Chunk 1183

1991, c. 64, a. 1297; I. N. 20140501. 1298. The property of a social trust that terminates by the impossibility of its fulfilment devolves to a trust, to a legal person or to any other group of persons devoted to a purpose as nearly like that of the trust as possible, designated by the court on the recommendation of the trustee. The court also obtains the advice of any person or body designated by law to supervise the trust. 1991, c. 64, a. 1298. TITLE SEVEN ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1299.
### Chunk 1184

Any person who is charged with the administration of property or a patrimony that is not his own assumes the office of administrator of the property of others. The rules of this Title apply to every administration unless another form of administration applies under the law or the constituting act, or due to circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1299. 1300. Unless the administration is gratuitous according to law, the act or the circumstances, the administrator is entitled to the remuneration fixed in the act, by usage or by law, or to the remuneration determined according to the value of the services rendered.
### Chunk 1185

A person acting without right or authorization is not entitled to any remuneration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1300; I. N. 20151101.

N. 20140501. 1303. An administrator shall continue the use or operation of the property which produces fruits and revenues without changing its destination, unless he is authorized to make such a change by the beneficiary or, in case of impediment, by the court.
### Chunk 1187

1991, c. 64, a. 1303; I. N. 20140501. 1304.

He may likewise change any investment made before he took office or that he has made himself. 1991, c. 64, a. 1304; I. N. 20140501. 1305. An administrator, with the authorization of the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary is prevented from acting, of the court, may alienate the property by onerous title or charge it with a hypothec where that is necessary for the payment of the debts, maintenance of the use for which the property is ordinarily destined, or the preservation of its value.

No administrator may exercise his powers in his own interest or that of a third person or place himself in a position where his personal interest is in conflict with his obligations as administrator.
### Chunk 1191

If the administrator himself is a beneficiary, he shall exercise his powers in the common interest, giving the same consideration to his own interest as to that of the other beneficiaries. 1991, c. 64, a. 1310. 1311. An administrator shall, without delay, declare to the beneficiary any interest he has in an enterprise that could place him in a position of conflict of interest as well as the rights he may invoke against the beneficiary or in the property administered, indicating, where applicable, the nature and value of the rights.

### Chunk 1194

1991, c. 64, a. 1314. 1315. Unless it is of the very nature of his administration to do so, no administrator may dispose gratuitously of the property entrusted to him, except property of little value disposed of in the interest of the beneficiary or of the object pursued. No administrator may, except for valuable consideration, renounce any right belonging to the beneficiary or forming part of the patrimony administered. 1991, c. 64, a. 1315; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. 1316.

If there are several beneficiaries of the administration, concurrently or successively, the administrator is bound to act impartially in their regard, taking account of their respective rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1317. 1318. The court, in appreciating the extent of the liability of an administrator and fixing the resulting damages, may reduce them in view of the circumstances in which the administration is assumed or of the fact that the administrator acts gratuitously or that he is a minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate.

Where an administrator binds himself, within the limits of his powers, in the name of the beneficiary or the trust patrimony, he is not personally liable to third persons with whom he contracts. He is liable to them if he binds himself in his own name, subject to any rights they have against the beneficiary or the trust patrimony. 1991, c. 64, a.

1319; I. N. 20140501. 1320. Where an administrator exceeds his powers, he is liable to third persons with whom he contracts unless the third persons were sufficiently aware of that fact or unless the obligations contracted were expressly or tacitly ratified by the beneficiary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1320; I. N. 20140501. 1321. An administrator who exercises alone powers that he is required to exercise jointly with another person exceeds his powers. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 274 of 556 ### Page 275 He does not exceed his powers if he exercises them more advantageously than he is required to do.
### Chunk 1198

1991, c. 64, a. 1321. 1322. The beneficiary is liable to third persons for injury caused by the fault of the administrator in carrying out his duties only up to the amount of the benefit he has derived from the act. In the case of a trust, these obligations fall back upon the trust patrimony. 1991, c. 64, a. 1322; I. N. 20140501. 1323. Where a person fully capable of exercising his civil rights has given reason to believe that another person was the administrator of his property, he is liable to third persons who in good faith have contracted with that other person, as though the property had been under administration.
### Chunk 1199

1991, c. 64, a. 1323; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III INVENTORY, SECURITY AND INSURANCE 1324. An administrator is not bound to make an inventory, to take out insurance or to furnish other security to guarantee the performance of his obligations unless required to do so by law or by the act, or, again, by the court on the application of the beneficiary or any interested person. Where the act creates these obligations, the administrator may apply for an exemption if circumstances warrant it.
### Chunk 1200

1991, c. 64, a. 1324. 1325. In making its decision upon an application, the court takes account of the value of the property administered, the situation of the parties and the other circumstances. It may not grant the application if that would have the effect of calling into question the terms of an agreement to which the administrator and the beneficiary were initially parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 1325; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 166. 1326. An administrator bound to make an inventory shall include in it a faithful and exact enumeration of all the property entrusted to his administration or constituting the administered patrimony.
### Chunk 1201

Such an inventory contains the following in particular: (1) the description of the immovables, and a description of the movables, with indication of their value and, in the case of a universality of movable property, sufficient identification of the universality; (2) a description of the currency in cash and other securities; (3) a listing of valuable documents. It also contains a statement of liabilities and concludes with a recapitulation of assets and liabilities. 1991, c. 64, a. 1326.
### Chunk 1202

1327. The inventory is made by notarial act en minute. It may also be made by a private writing before two witnesses. In the latter case, the author and the witnesses sign it, indicating the date and place of execution. 1991, c. 64, a. 1327. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 275 of 556 ### Page 276 1328. Where the administered patrimony contains personal effects of the holder of the patrimony or, as the case may be, of the deceased, it is sufficient to make a general reference to them in the inventory and to list or describe only those worth over $100 each consisting of clothing, personal papers, jewelry or items of everyday use.
### Chunk 1203

1991, c. 64, a. 1328; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 167. 1329. The property described in the inventory is presumed to be in good condition on the date of preparation of the inventory, unless the administrator appends a document attesting the contrary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1329. 1330. The administrator shall furnish a copy of the inventory to the person who charged him with the administration and to the beneficiary of the administration, and also to every person he knows to have an interest.
### Chunk 1204

He shall also, where required by law, file the inventory or notice of the closure of the inventory in the indicated place, specifying in the latter case where the inventory may be consulted. Any interested person may contest the inventory or any item therein; he may also demand that a new inventory be prepared. 1991, c. 64, a. 1330; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1331. An administrator may insure the property entrusted to him against ordinary risks such as fire and theft at the expense of the beneficiary or trust.
### Chunk 1205

He may also take out insurance guaranteeing the performance of his obligations; he does so at the expense of the beneficiary or trust if his administration is gratuitous. 1991, c. 64, a. 1331. DIVISION IV JOINT ADMINISTRATION AND DELEGATION 1332. Where several administrators are charged with the administration, a majority of them may act unless the act or the law requires them to act jointly or in a determinate proportion. 1991, c. 64, a. 1332. 1333. Where the administrators are prevented from acting as a majority or in the specified proportion, owing to an impediment or the systematic opposition of some of them, the others may act alone for conservatory acts; they may also, with the authorization of the court, act alone for acts requiring immediate action.
### Chunk 1206

Where the situation persists and the administration is seriously impeded as a result, the court, on the application of an interested person, may exempt the administrators from acting in the specified proportion, divide their duties, give a casting vote to one of them or make any order it sees fit in the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1333; I. N. 20140501. 1334. Joint administrators are solidarily liable for their administration. However, where the duties of joint administrators have been divided by law, the act or the court, and the division has been respected, each administrator is liable for his own administration only.

1991, c. 64, a. 1334. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 276 of 556 ### Page 277 1335. An administrator is presumed to have approved any decision made by his coadministrators. He is liable with them for the decision unless he immediately indicates his dissent to them and notifies it to the beneficiary within a reasonable time. The administrator may be relieved of liability, however, if he proves that he was unable for serious reasons to make his dissent known to the beneficiary in due time.
### Chunk 1208

1991, c. 64, a. 1335. 1336. An administrator is presumed to have approved a decision made in his absence unless he makes his dissent known to the other administrators and to the beneficiary within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the decision. 1991, c. 64, a. 1336. 1337. An administrator may delegate his duties or be represented by a third person for specific acts; however, he may not delegate generally the conduct of the administration or the exercise of a discretionary power, except to his coadministrators.
### Chunk 1209

He is accountable for the person selected by him if, among other things, he was not authorized to make the selection. If he was so authorized, he is accountable only for the care with which he selected the person and gave him instructions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1337. 1338. A beneficiary who suffers injury may repudiate the acts of the person mandated by the administrator if they are done contrary to the constituting act or to usage. The beneficiary may also exercise his remedies against the mandated person even where the administrator could validly confer the mandate.

1991, c. 64, a. 1339; 2002, c. 19, s. 7; 2002, c. 45, s. 159; 2004, c. 37, s. 90; 2006, c. 50, s. 112; 2007, c. 16, s. 4; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 169; 2018, c. 23, s. 713; 2020, c. 1, s. 171. 1340. The administrator decides on the investments to make according to the yield and the anticipated capital gain; so far as possible, he works towards a diversified portfolio producing fixed income and variable revenues in the proportion suggested by the prevailing economic conditions.
### Chunk 1214

He may not, however, acquire more than five per cent of the shares of the same company, nor acquire shares, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of a legal person or limited partnership which has failed to pay the dividends set for its shares or the interest on its bonds or other securities, nor grant a loan to that legal person or partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 1340; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1341. An administrator may deposit the sums of money entrusted to him in or with a bank, a savings and credit union or any other financial institution, if the deposit is repayable on demand or on 30 days’ notice.
### Chunk 1215

An administrator may maintain the existing investments upon his taking office even if they are not investments presumed sound.
### Chunk 1216

The administrator may also hold securities which, following the reorganization, windingup or amalgamation of a legal person, replace securities he held. 1991, c. 64, a. 1342; I. N. 20140501. 1343. An administrator who acts in accordance with this section is presumed to act prudently. An administrator who makes an investment he is not authorized to make is, by that very fact and without further proof of fault, liable for any loss resulting from it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1343. 1344.
### Chunk 1217

Investments made in the course of administration shall be made in the name of the administrator as acting in that quality. Such investments may also be made in the name of the beneficiary, if it is also indicated that they are made by the administrator as acting in that quality. 1991, c. 64, a. 1344; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION VI APPORTIONMENT OF PROFIT AND EXPENDITURE 1345. Apportionment of profit and expenditure between the beneficiary of the fruits and revenues and the beneficiary of the capital is made in accordance with the stipulations and clear intention of the constituting act.
### Chunk 1218

Failing sufficient indication in the act, apportionment is made as equitably as possible, taking into account the object of the administration, the circumstances that gave rise to it and generally recognized accounting practices. 1991, c. 64, a. 1345. 1346. The revenue account is generally debited for the following expenditures and other expenditures of the same kind: (1) insurance premiums, the cost of minor repairs and other ordinary expenses of administration; (2) onehalf of the remuneration of the administrator and his reasonable expenses for joint administration of the capital and fruits and revenues; (3) taxes payable on the administered property; (4) unless the court orders otherwise, costs paid to safeguard the rights of the beneficiary of the fruits and revenues and onehalf of the cost of the judicial rendering of account; (5) amortization of the property, except property used by the beneficiary for personal purposes.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 279 of 556 ### Page 280 The administrator may, to maintain revenue at a regular level, spread substantial expenses over a reasonable period. 1991, c. 64, a. 1346. 1347. The capital account is generally debited for expenditures that are not debited from the revenues, including expenses pertaining to capital investment, alienation of property, and safeguard of the rights of the capital beneficiary or the right of ownership of the administered property.
### Chunk 1220

Taxes on gains and other amounts attributable to capital, even where the law governing such taxes considers them to be income taxes, are also generally debited from the capital account. 1991, c. 64, a. 1347. 1348. The beneficiary of the fruits and revenues is entitled to the net income of the administered property from the date determined in the act giving rise to the administration or, if no date is determined, from the date of the beginning of the administration or that of the death which gave rise to it.
### Chunk 1221

1991, c. 64, a. 1348. 1349. Fruits and revenues payable periodically are counted day by day. Dividends and distributions of a legal person are due from the date indicated in the declaration of distribution or, failing that, from the date of the declaration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1349. 1350. At the extinction of his right, the beneficiary of the fruits and revenues is entitled to the fruits and revenues that have not been paid to him and to the portion earned but not yet collected by the administrator.
### Chunk 1222

He is not entitled, however, to the dividends of a legal person that were not declared during the period his right existed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1350. DIVISION VII ANNUAL ACCOUNT 1351. An administrator renders a summary account of his administration to the beneficiary at least once a year. 1991, c. 64, a. 1351. 1352. The account shall be sufficiently detailed to allow verification of its accuracy. Any interested person may, on a rendering of account, apply to the court for an order that the account be audited by an expert.
### Chunk 1223

1991, c. 64, a. 1352; I. N. 20140501. 1353. Where there are several administrators, they shall render one and the same account unless their duties have been divided by law, the act or the court, and the division has been respected. 1991, c. 64, a. 1353; 2016, c. 4, s. 170. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 280 of 556 ### Page 281 1354.

### Chunk 1224

1991, c. 64, a. 1354. CHAPTER IV TERMINATION OF ADMINISTRATION DIVISION I CAUSES TERMINATING ADMINISTRATION 1355. The duties of an administrator terminate upon his death, resignation or replacement, his becoming bankrupt, or tutorship to a person of full age being instituted or a protection mandate homologated for him. The duties of an administrator are also terminated where the beneficiary becomes bankrupt or tutorship to a person of full age is instituted or a protection mandate homologated for him, if that affects the administered property.
### Chunk 1225

1991, c. 64, a. 1355; 2020, c. 11, s. 70. 1356. Administration is terminated (1) by extinction of the right of the beneficiary in the administered property; (2) by expiry of the term or fulfilment of the condition stipulated in the act giving rise to the administration; (3) by achievement of the object of the administration or disappearance of the cause that gave rise to it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1356. 1357. An administrator may resign by giving written notice to the beneficiary and, where applicable, to his coadministrators or to the person who may appoint an administrator in his place.
### Chunk 1226

Where there are no such persons or where it is impossible to give notice to them, the notice is given to the Minister of Revenue who, if necessary, assumes the provisional administration of the property and causes a new administrator to be appointed in place of the administrator who has resigned. The administrator of a private trust or social trust shall also give notice of his resignation to the person or body designated by law to supervise his administration. 1991, c. 64, a. 1357; 2005, c.
### Chunk 1227

44, s. 54; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 171. 1358. The resignation of the administrator takes effect on the date the notice is received or on any later date indicated in the notice. 1991, c. 64, a. 1358. 1359. An administrator is bound to make reparation for injury caused by his resignation where it is submitted without a serious reason and at an inopportune moment or where it amounts to failure of duty. 1991, c. 64, a. 1359; I. N. 20140501. 1360. A beneficiary who has entrusted the administration of property to another person may replace the administrator or terminate the administration, particularly by exercising his right to require that the property be returned to him on demand.
### Chunk 1228

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 281 of 556 ### Page 282 Any interested person may apply for the replacement of an administrator who is unable to perform his duties or does not fulfil his obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 1360; I. N. 20140501. 1361. Upon the death of the administrator or tutorship to a person of full age being instituted or a protection mandate homologated for him, the liquidator of his succession, or his tutor or mandatary, if aware of the administration, is bound to give notice of the event to the beneficiary and to the coadministrators, if any, or, in the case of a private trust or social trust, to the person or body designated by law to supervise the administration.
### Chunk 1229

The liquidator, tutor or mandatary is also bound, with respect to any matter already begun, to do all that is immediately necessary to prevent a loss; he shall also render account and hand over the property to those entitled to it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1361; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 71. 1362. Obligations contracted towards third persons in good faith by an administrator who is unaware that his administration has terminated are valid and bind the beneficiary or the trust patrimony; the same rule applies to obligations contracted by the administrator after the end of the administration that are its necessary consequence or are required to prevent a loss.
### Chunk 1230

The beneficiary or the trust patrimony is also bound by the obligations contracted towards third persons who were unaware that the administration had terminated. 1991, c. 64, a. 1362. DIVISION II RENDERING OF ACCOUNT AND DELIVERY OF PROPERTY 1363. On the termination of his administration, an administrator shall render a final account of his administration to the beneficiary and, where applicable, to the administrator replacing him or to his co administrators. Where there are several administrators and their offices are terminated simultaneously, they shall render one and the same account, except where their duties are divided.
### Chunk 1231

The account shall be made sufficiently detailed to allow verification of its accuracy; the books and other vouchers pertaining to the administration may be consulted by interested persons. The acceptance of the account by the beneficiary closes the account. 1991, c. 64, a. 1363; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 172. 1364. An administrator may at any time and with the consent of all the beneficiaries render account by agreement. If there is no agreement, the rendering of account is made judicially.
### Chunk 1232

1991, c. 64, a. 1364. 1365. An administrator shall hand over the administered property at the place agreed upon or, failing that, where it is. 1991, c. 64, a. 1365; I. N. 20140501. 1366. An administrator shall hand over all that he has received in the performance of his duties, even if what he has received was not due to the beneficiary or to the trust patrimony; he is also accountable for any CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 282 of 556 ### Page 283 personal profit or benefit he has realized by using, without authorization, information he had obtained by reason of his administration.
### Chunk 1233

Where an administrator has used property without authorization, he is bound to indemnify the beneficiary or the trust patrimony for his use by paying an appropriate rent or the interest on the money. 1991, c. 64, a. 1366; I. N. 20140501. 1367. The expenses of the administration, including the cost of rendering account and handing over the property, are borne by the beneficiary or the trust patrimony. The resignation or replacement of the administrator binds the beneficiary or the trust patrimony to pay him, in addition to the expenses of the administration, any remuneration he has earned.
### Chunk 1234

1991, c. 64, a. 1367; I. N. 20140501. 1368. An administrator owes interest on the balance from the close of the final account or the date of the demand requiring him to produce it; the beneficiary or the trust patrimony owes interest only from the date of the demand. 1991, c. 64, a. 1368; I. N. 20151101. 1369. An administrator is entitled to deduct from the sums he is required to remit anything the beneficiary or the trust patrimony owes him by reason of the administration.
### Chunk 1235

An administrator may retain the administered property until payment of what is owed to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 1369. 1370. Where there are several beneficiaries, their obligation towards the administrator is solidary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1370. BOOK FIVE OBLIGATIONS TITLE ONE OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 1371. It is of the essence of an obligation that there be persons between whom it exists, a prestation which forms its object, and, in the case of an obligation arising out of a juridical act, a cause which justifies its existence.
### Chunk 1236

1991, c. 64, a. 1371. 1372. An obligation arises from a contract or from any act or fact to which the effects of an obligation are attached by law. An obligation may be pure and simple or subject to modalities. 1991, c. 64, a. 1372. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 283 of 556 ### Page 284 1373. The object of an obligation is the prestation that the debtor is bound to render to the creditor and which consists in doing or not doing something.
### Chunk 1237

The debtor is bound to render a prestation that is possible and determinate or determinable and that is neither forbidden by law nor contrary to public order. 1991, c. 64, a. 1373. 1374. The prestation may relate to any property, even future property, provided that the property is determinate as to kind and determinable as to quantity. 1991, c. 64, a. 1374. 1375. The parties shall conduct themselves in good faith both at the time the obligation arises and at the time it is performed or extinguished.
### Chunk 1238

1991, c. 64, a. 1375; I. N. 20140501. 1376. The rules set forth in this Book apply to the State and its bodies, and to all other legal persons established in the public interest, subject to any other rules of law which may be applicable to them. 1991, c. 64, a. 1376. CHAPTER II CONTRACTS DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISION 1377. The general rules set out in this chapter apply to all contracts, regardless of their nature. For certain contracts, special rules which complement or depart from these general rules are established under Title Two of this Book.
### Chunk 1239

1991, c. 64, a. 1377; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II NATURE AND CERTAIN CLASSES OF CONTRACTS 1378. A contract is an agreement of wills by which one or several persons obligate themselves to one or several other persons to perform a prestation. Contracts may be divided into contracts of adhesion and contracts by mutual agreement, synallagmatic and unilateral contracts, onerous and gratuitous contracts, commutative and aleatory contracts, and contracts of instantaneous performance or of successive performance; they may also be consumer contracts.
### Chunk 1240

1991, c. 64, a. 1378. 1379. A contract of adhesion is a contract in which the essential stipulations were imposed or drawn up by one of the parties, on his behalf or upon his instructions, and were not negotiable. Any contract that is not a contract of adhesion is a contract by mutual agreement. 1991, c. 64, a. 1379. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 284 of 556 ### Page 285 1380. A contract is synallagmatic, or bilateral, when the parties obligate themselves reciprocally, each to the other, so that the obligation of one party is correlative to the obligation of the other.
### Chunk 1241

When one party obligates himself to the other without any obligation on the part of the latter, the contract is unilateral. 1991, c. 64, a. 1380. 1381. A contract is onerous when each party obtains an advantage in return for his obligation. When one party obligates himself to the other for the benefit of the latter without obtaining any advantage in return, the contract is gratuitous. 1991, c. 64, a. 1381. 1382. A contract is commutative when, at the time it is formed, the extent of the obligations of the parties and of the advantages obtained by them in return is certain and determinate.
### Chunk 1242

When the extent of the obligations or of the advantages is uncertain, the contract is aleatory. 1991, c. 64, a. 1382. 1383. Where the nature of things does not preclude the performance of the obligations of the parties at one single time, the contract is a contract of instantaneous performance. Where the nature of things requires that the obligations be performed at several different times or on a continuing basis, the contract is a contract of successive performance. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1243

1383; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 173. 1384. A consumer contract is a contract whose field of application is delimited by legislation respecting consumer protection whereby one of the parties, being a natural person, the consumer, acquires, leases, borrows or obtains in any other manner, for personal, family or domestic purposes, property or services from the other party, who offers such property or services as part of an enterprise which he carries on. 1991, c. 64, a. 1384; 2016, c.
### Chunk 1244

4, s. 174. DIVISION III FORMATION OF CONTRACTS § 1. — Conditions of formation of contracts I. — General provision 1385. A contract is formed by the sole exchange of consents between persons having capacity to contract, unless, in addition, the law requires a particular form to be respected as a necessary condition of its formation, or unless the parties subject the formation of the contract to a solemn form. It is also of the essence of a contract that it have a cause and an object.

The exchange of consents is accomplished by the express or tacit manifestation of the will of a person to accept an offer to contract made to him by another person. 1991, c. 64, a. 1386. 1387. A contract is formed when and where acceptance is received by the offeror, regardless of the method of communication used, and even though the parties have agreed to reserve agreement as to certain secondary elements.
### Chunk 1246

1991, c. 64, a. 1387; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 175. 2. — Offer and acceptance 1388. An offer to contract is a proposal which contains all the essential elements of the proposed contract and in which the offeror signifies his willingness to be bound if it is accepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 1388. 1389. An offer to contract derives from the person who initiates the contract or the person who determines its content or even, in certain cases, the person who presents the last essential element of the proposed contract.
### Chunk 1247

1991, c. 64, a. 1389. 1390. An offer to contract may be made to a determinate or an indeterminate person, and a term for acceptance may or may not be attached to it. Where a term is attached, the offer may not be revoked before the term expires; if none is attached, the offer may be revoked at any time before acceptance is received by the offeror. 1991, c. 64, a. 1390. 1391. Where the offeree receives a revocation before the offer, the offer lapses, even though a term is attached to it.
### Chunk 1248

1991, c. 64, a. 1391. 1392. An offer lapses if no acceptance is received by the offeror before the expiry of the specified term or, where no term is specified, before the expiry of a reasonable time; it also lapses with respect to the offeree if he has rejected it. The death or bankruptcy of the offeror or the offeree, whether or not a term is attached to the offer, or the institution of tutorship to a person of full age or the homologation of a protection mandate for either of them also causes the offer to lapse, if that event occurs before acceptance is received by the offeror.
### Chunk 1249

1991, c. 64, a. 1392; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 72. 1393. Acceptance which does not correspond substantially to the offer or which is received by the offeror after the offer has lapsed does not constitute acceptance. It may, however, constitute a new offer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1393. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 286 of 556 ### Page 287 1394. Silence does not imply acceptance of an offer, unless the contrary results from the will of the parties, the law or special circumstances, such as usage or a prior business relationship.
### Chunk 1250

1991, c. 64, a. 1394; I. N. 20140501. 1395. The offer of a reward made to anyone who performs a particular act is deemed to be accepted and is binding on the offeror as soon as the act is performed, even if the person who performs the act does not know of the offer, unless, in cases which admit of it, the offer was previously revoked expressly and adequately by the offeror. 1991, c. 64, a. 1395; I. N. 20140501. 1396. An offer to contract made to a determinate person constitutes a promise to enter into the proposed contract from the moment that the offeree clearly indicates to the offeror that he intends to consider the offer and reply to it within a reasonable time or within the time stated therein.
### Chunk 1251

A mere promise is not equivalent to the proposed contract; however, where the beneficiary of the promise accepts the promise or takes up his option, both he and the promisor are bound to enter into the contract, unless the beneficiary decides to enter into the contract immediately. 1991, c. 64, a. 1396. 1397. A contract made in violation of a promise to contract may be set up against the beneficiary of the promise, but without affecting his remedy for damages against the promisor and the person having contracted in bad faith with the promisor.
### Chunk 1252

The same rule applies to a contract made in violation of a first refusal agreement. 1991, c. 64, a. 1397. 3. — Qualities and defects of consent 1398. Consent may be given only by a person who, at the time of manifesting such consent, either expressly or tacitly, is capable of binding himself. 1991, c. 64, a. 1398. 1399. Consent must be free and enlightened. It may be vitiated by error, fear or lesion. 1991, c. 64, a. 1399; I. N. 20140501. 1400. Error vitiates the consent of the parties or of one of them where the error relates to the nature of the contract, to the object of the prestation or to any essential element that determined the consent.
### Chunk 1253

An inexcusable error does not constitute a defect of consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1400; I. N. 20140501. 1401. Error on the part of one party induced by fraud committed by the other party or with his knowledge vitiates consent whenever, but for that error, the party would not have contracted, or would have contracted on different terms. Fraud may result from silence or concealment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1401. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 287 of 556 ### Page 288 1402.
### Chunk 1254

Fear of serious injury to the person or property of one of the parties vitiates consent given by that party where the fear is induced by violence or threats exerted or made by or known to the other party. Apprehended injury may also relate to another person or his property and is appraised according to the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1402. 1403. Fear induced by the abusive exercise of a right or power or by the threat of such exercise vitiates consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1403.
### Chunk 1255

1404. Consent to a contract the object of which is to deliver the person making it from fear of serious injury is not vitiated where the other contracting party, although aware of the state of necessity, is acting in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 1404. 1405. Except in the cases expressly provided by law, lesion vitiates consent only with respect to minors and persons of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 1405; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c.
### Chunk 1256

11, s. 73. 1406. Lesion results from the exploitation of one of the parties by the other, which creates a serious disproportion between the prestations of the parties; the fact that there is a serious disproportion creates a presumption of exploitation. In cases involving a minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate, lesion may also result from an obligation that is considered to be excessive in view of the patrimonial situation of the person, the advantages he gains from the contract and the circumstances as a whole.
### Chunk 1257

1991, c. 64, a. 1406; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 74. 1407. A person whose consent is vitiated has the right to apply for annulment of the contract; in the case of error occasioned by fraud, of fear or of lesion, he may, in addition to annulment, also claim damages or, where he prefers that the contract be maintained, apply for a reduction of his obligation equivalent to the damages he would be justified in claiming. 1991, c. 64, a. 1407. 1408. In a case of lesion, the court may maintain a contract for which annulment is sought, if the defendant offers a reduction of his claim or an equitable pecuniary supplement.
### Chunk 1258

1991, c. 64, a. 1408; I. N. 20140501. III. — Capacity to contract 1409. The rules relating to the capacity to contract are established principally in the Book on Persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 1409; I. N. 20140501. IV. — Cause of contracts 1410. The cause of a contract is the reason that determines each of the parties to enter into the contract. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 288 of 556 ### Page 289 The cause need not be expressed.
### Chunk 1259

1991, c. 64, a. 1410. 1411. A contract whose cause is prohibited by law or contrary to public order is null. 1991, c. 64, a. 1411. V. — Object of contracts 1412. The object of a contract is the juridical operation envisaged by the parties at the time of its formation, as it emerges from all the rights and obligations created by the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1412. 1413. A contract whose object is prohibited by law or contrary to public order is null. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1260

1413. VI. — Form of contracts 1414. Where a particular or solemn form is required as a necessary condition for the formation of a contract, it must be observed; it must also be observed for any modification to the contract, unless the modification is only an accessory stipulation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1414; I. N. 20140501. 1415. A promise to enter into a contract is not subject to the form required for the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1415. § 2. — Sanction of conditions of formation of contracts I.
### Chunk 1261

— Nature of nullity 1416. Any contract which does not meet the necessary conditions of its formation may be annulled. 1991, c. 64, a. 1416. 1417. A contract is absolutely null where the condition of formation sanctioned by its nullity is necessary for the protection of the general interest. 1991, c. 64, a. 1417. 1418. The absolute nullity of a contract may be invoked by any person having a present and actual interest in doing so; it is invoked by the court of its own motion.
### Chunk 1262

A contract that is absolutely null may not be confirmed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1418. 1419. A contract is relatively null where the condition of formation sanctioned by its nullity is necessary for the protection of an individual interest, such as where the consent of the parties or of one of them is vitiated. 1991, c. 64, a. 1419. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 289 of 556 ### Page 290 1420. The relative nullity of a contract may be invoked only by the person in whose interest it is established or by the other contracting party, provided he is acting in good faith and suffers serious injury therefrom; it may not be invoked by the court of its own motion.
### Chunk 1263

A contract that is relatively null may be confirmed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1420; I. N. 20140501. 1421. Unless the nature of the nullity is clearly indicated in the law, a contract which does not meet the necessary conditions of its formation is presumed to be relatively null. 1991, c. 64, a. 1421. II. — Effect of nullity 1422. A contract that is null is deemed never to have existed. In such a case, each party is bound to restore to the other the prestations he has received.
### Chunk 1264

1991, c. 64, a. 1422. III. — Confirmation of the contract 1423. The confirmation of a contract results from the express or tacit will to renounce the invocation of its nullity. The will to confirm must be certain and evident. 1991, c. 64, a. 1423; I. N. 20140501. 1424. Where the nullity of a contract may be invoked by each of the parties or by several of them against a common other contracting party, confirmation by one of them does not prevent the others from invoking nullity.
### Chunk 1265

1991, c. 64, a. 1424; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION IV INTERPRETATION OF CONTRACTS 1425. The common intention of the parties rather than adherence to the literal meaning of the words shall be sought in interpreting a contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1425. 1426. In interpreting a contract, the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, the interpretation which has already been given to it by the parties or which it may have received, and usage, are all taken into account.
### Chunk 1266

1991, c. 64, a. 1426. 1427. Each clause of a contract is interpreted in light of the others so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole. 1991, c. 64, a. 1427. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 290 of 556 ### Page 291 1428. A clause is given a meaning that gives it some effect rather than one that gives it no effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1428. 1429. Words susceptible of two meanings shall be given the meaning that best conforms to the subject matter of the contract.
### Chunk 1267

1991, c. 64, a. 1429. 1430. A clause intended to eliminate doubt as to the application of the contract to a specific situation does not restrict the scope of a contract otherwise expressed in general terms. 1991, c. 64, a. 1430. 1431. The clauses of a contract cover only what it appears that the parties intended to include, however general the terms used. 1991, c. 64, a. 1431. 1432. In case of doubt, a contract is interpreted in favour of the person who contracted the obligation and against the person who stipulated it.
### Chunk 1268

In all cases, it is interpreted in favour of the adhering party or the consumer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1432. DIVISION V EFFECTS OF CONTRACTS § 1. — Effects of contracts between the parties I. — General provision 1433. A contract creates obligations and, in certain cases, modifies or extinguishes them. In some cases, it also has the effect of creating, transferring, modifying or extinguishing real rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1433; I. N. 20140501. II. — Binding force and content of contracts 1434.
### Chunk 1269

A contract validly formed binds the parties who have entered into it not only as to what they have expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature and in conformity with usage, equity or law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1434. 1435. An external clause referred to in a contract is binding on the parties. In a consumer contract or a contract of adhesion, however, an external clause is null if, at the time of formation of the contract, it was not expressly brought to the attention of the consumer or adhering party, unless the other party proves that the consumer or adhering party otherwise knew of it.
### Chunk 1270

1991, c. 64, a. 1435. 1436. In a consumer contract or a contract of adhesion, a clause which is illegible or incomprehensible to a reasonable person is null if the consumer or the adhering party suffers injury therefrom, unless the other CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 291 of 556 ### Page 292 party proves that an adequate explanation of the nature and scope of the clause was given to the consumer or adhering party. 1991, c. 64, a. 1436.
### Chunk 1271

1437. An abusive clause in a consumer contract or contract of adhesion is null, or the obligation arising from it may be reduced. An abusive clause is a clause which is excessively and unreasonably detrimental to the consumer or the adhering party and is therefore contrary to the requirements of good faith; in particular, a clause which so departs from the fundamental obligations arising from the rules normally governing the contract that it changes the nature of the contract is an abusive clause.
### Chunk 1272

1991, c. 64, a. 1437; 2016, c. 4, s. 176. 1438. A clause which is null does not render the contract invalid in other respects, unless it is apparent that the contract may be considered only as an indivisible whole. The same applies to a clause that is without effect or that is deemed unwritten. 1991, c. 64, a. 1438; I. N. 20140501. 1439. A contract may not be resolved, resiliated, modified or revoked except on grounds recognized by law or by agreement of the parties.
### Chunk 1273

1991, c. 64, a. 1439. § 2. — Effects of contracts with respect to third persons I. — General provisions 1440. A contract has effect only between the contracting parties; it does not affect third persons, except where provided by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1440. 1441. Upon the death of one of the parties, the rights and obligations arising from a contract pass to his heirs, if the nature of the contract permits it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1441. 1442. The rights of the parties to a contract pass to their successors by particular title if the rights are accessory to the property which passes to them or are closely related to it.
### Chunk 1274

1991, c. 64, a. 1442; I. N. 20140501. II. — Promise for another 1443. No person may bind anyone but himself and his heirs by a contract made in his own name, but he may promise in his own name that a third person will undertake to perform an obligation, and in that case he is liable for injury to the other contracting party if the third person does not undertake to perform the obligation as promised. 1991, c. 64, a. 1443; I. N. 20140501. III. — Stipulation for another 1444.
### Chunk 1275

A person may, in a contract, stipulate for the benefit of a third person. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 292 of 556 ### Page 293 The stipulation gives the third person beneficiary the right to exact performance of the promised obligation directly from the promisor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1444; I. N. 20140501. 1445. A third person beneficiary need not exist nor be determinate when the stipulation is made; he need only be determinable at that time and exist when the promisor is to perform the obligation for his benefit.
### Chunk 1276

1991, c. 64, a. 1445. 1446. The stipulation may be revoked as long as the third person beneficiary has not advised the stipulator or the promisor of his will to accept it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1446. 1447. Only the stipulator may revoke a stipulation; neither his heirs nor his creditors may do so. If the promisor has an interest in maintaining the stipulation, however, the stipulator may not revoke it without his consent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1447. 1448. Revocation of the stipulation has effect as soon as it is made known to the promisor; if it is made by will, however, it has effect upon the opening of the succession.
### Chunk 1277

Where a new beneficiary is not designated, revocation benefits the stipulator or his heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1448. 1449. A third person beneficiary or his heirs may validly accept the stipulation, even after the death of the stipulator or promisor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1449. 1450. A promisor may set up against the third person beneficiary such defenses as he could have set up against the stipulator. 1991, c. 64, a. 1450. IV. — Simulation 1451. Simulation exists where the parties agree to express their true intent, not in an apparent contract, but in a secret contract, also called a counter letter.
### Chunk 1278

Between the parties, a counter letter prevails over an apparent contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1451. 1452. Third persons in good faith may, according to their interest, avail themselves of the apparent contract or the counter letter; however, where conflicts of interest arise between them, preference is given to the person who avails himself of the apparent contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1452. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 293 of 556 ### Page 294 § 3.
### Chunk 1279

— Special effects of certain contracts I. — Transfer of real rights 1453. The transfer of a real right in certain and determinate property, or in several properties considered as a universality, vests the acquirer with the right upon the formation of the contract, even though the property is not delivered immediately and an operation may still remain necessary for the price to be determined. The transfer of a real right in property determined only as to kind vests the acquirer with that right as soon as he is notified that the property is certain and determinate.
### Chunk 1280

1991, c. 64, a. 1453; I. N. 20140501. 1454. If a party transfers the same real right in the same movable property to different acquirers successively, the acquirer in good faith who is first given possession of the property is vested with the real right in that property, even though his title may be later in time. 1991, c. 64, a. 1454. 1455. The transfer of a real right in immovable property may not be set up against third persons except in accordance with the rules concerning the publication of rights.
### Chunk 1281

1991, c. 64, a. 1455; I. N. 20140501. II. — Fruits and revenues and risks incident to property 1456. The allocation of fruits and revenues and the assumption of risks incident to property forming the object of a real right transferred by contract are principally governed by the Book on Property. The debtor of the obligation to deliver the property continues, however, to bear the risks attached to the property until it is delivered. 1991, c. 64, a. 1456. CHAPTER III CIVIL LIABILITY DIVISION I CONDITIONS OF LIABILITY § 1.
### Chunk 1282

— General provisions 1457. Every person has a duty to abide by the rules of conduct incumbent on him, according to the circumstances, usage or law, so as not to cause injury to another. Where he is endowed with reason and fails in this duty, he is liable for any injury he causes to another by such fault and is bound to make reparation for the injury, whether it be bodily, moral or material in nature. He is also bound, in certain cases, to make reparation for injury caused to another by the act, omission or fault of another person or by the act of things in his custody.
### Chunk 1283

1991, c. 64, a. 1457; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 177. 1458. Every person has a duty to honour his contractual undertakings. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 294 of 556 ### Page 295 Where he fails in this duty, he is liable for any bodily, moral or material injury he causes to the other contracting party and is bound to make reparation for the injury; neither he nor the other party may in such a case avoid the rules governing contractual liability by opting for rules that would be more favourable to them.
### Chunk 1284

1991, c. 64, a. 1458; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Act, omission or fault of another 2016, c. 4, s. 178. 1459. A person having parental authority is bound to make reparation for injury caused to another by the act, omission or fault of a minor under his authority, unless he proves that he himself did not commit any fault with regard to the custody, supervision or education of the minor. A person deprived of parental authority is bound in the same manner, if the act, omission or fault of the minor is related to the education he has given to him.
### Chunk 1285

1991, c. 64, a. 1459; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 179. 1460. A person who, without having parental authority, is entrusted, by delegation or otherwise, with the custody, supervision or education of a minor is bound, in the same manner as the person having parental authority, to make reparation for injury caused by the act, omission or fault of the minor. Where he is acting gratuitously or for reward, however, he is not so bound unless it is proved that he has committed a fault.
### Chunk 1286

1991, c. 64, a. 1460; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 180. 1461. Any person who, as tutor, mandatary or otherwise, assumes custody of a person of full age who is not endowed with reason, is not bound to make reparation for injury caused by an act or omission of the person of full age, except where he has himself committed an intentional or gross fault in exercising custody. 1991, c. 64, a. 1461; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 181; 2020, c. 11, s. 75. 1462. A person is liable for injury caused to another by an act or omission of a person not endowed with reason only in cases where the conduct of the person not endowed with reason would otherwise have been considered wrongful.
### Chunk 1287

1991, c. 64, a. 1462; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1463. The principal is bound to make reparation for injury caused by the fault of his subordinates in the performance of their duties; nevertheless, he retains his remedies against them. 1991, c. 64, a. 1463; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 182. 1464. A subordinate of the State or of a legal person established in the public interest does not cease to act in the performance of his duties by the mere fact that he performs an act that is illegal, beyond his authority or unauthorized, or by the fact that he is acting as a peace officer.
### Chunk 1288

1991, c. 64, a. 1464; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 183. § 3. — Act of a thing 1465. The custodian of a thing is bound to make reparation for injury resulting from the autonomous act of the thing, unless he proves that he is not at fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 1465; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 295 of 556 ### Page 296 1466. The owner of an animal is bound to make reparation for injury it has caused, whether the animal was under his custody or that of a third person, or had strayed or escaped.
### Chunk 1289

A person making use of the animal is also, during that time, liable therefor together with the owner. 1991, c. 64, a. 1466; I. N. 20140501. 1467. The owner of an immovable, without prejudice to his liability as custodian, is bound to make reparation for injury caused by its ruin, even partial, whether the ruin has resulted from lack of repair or from a defect in construction. 1991, c. 64, a. 1467; I. N. 20140501. 1468. The manufacturer of a movable thing is bound to make reparation for injury caused to a third person by reason of a safety defect in the thing, even if it is incorporated with or placed in an immovable for the service or operation of the immovable.
### Chunk 1290

The same rule applies to a person who distributes the thing under his name or as his own and to any supplier of the thing, whether a wholesaler or a retailer and whether or not he imported the thing. 1991, c. 64, a. 1468; I. N. 20140501. 1469. A thing has a safety defect where, having regard to all the circumstances, it does not afford the safety which a person is normally entitled to expect, particularly by reason of a defect in design or manufacture, poor preservation or presentation, or the lack of sufficient indications as to the risks and dangers it involves or as to the means to avoid them.
### Chunk 1291

1991, c. 64, a. 1469; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II CERTAIN CASES OF EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY 1470. A person may free himself from his liability for injury caused to another by proving that the injury results from superior force, unless he has undertaken to make reparation for it. Superior force is an unforeseeable and irresistible event, including external causes with the same characteristics. 1991, c. 64, a. 1470; I. N. 20140501. 1471. Where a person comes to the assistance of another or, for an unselfish motive, gratuitously disposes of property for the benefit of another, he is exempt from all liability for injury that may result, unless the injury is due to his intentional or gross fault.
### Chunk 1292

1991, c. 64, a. 1471; I. N. 20140501. 1472. A person may free himself from his liability for injury caused to another as a result of the disclosure of a trade secret by proving that considerations of general interest prevailed over keeping the secret and, particularly, that its disclosure was justified for reasons of public health or safety. 1991, c. 64, a. 1472. 1473. The manufacturer, distributor or supplier of a movable thing is not bound to make reparation for injury caused by a safety defect in the thing if he proves that the victim knew or could have known of the defect, or could have foreseen the injury.
### Chunk 1293

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 296 of 556 ### Page 297 Nor is he bound to make reparation if he proves that, according to the state of knowledge at the time that he manufactured, distributed or supplied the thing, the existence of the defect could not have been known, and that he was not neglectful of his duty to provide information when he became aware of the defect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1473; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101.
### Chunk 1294

1474. A person may not exclude or limit his liability for material injury caused to another through an intentional or gross fault; a gross fault is a fault which shows gross recklessness, gross carelessness or gross negligence. He may not in any way exclude or limit his liability for bodily or moral injury caused to another. 1991, c. 64, a. 1474. 1475. A notice, whether posted or not, stipulating the exclusion or limitation of the obligation to make reparation for injury resulting from the nonperformance of a contractual obligation has effect, with respect to the creditor, only if the party who invokes the notice proves that the other party was aware of its existence at the time the contract was formed.
### Chunk 1295

1991, c. 64, a. 1475; I. N. 20140501. 1476. A person may not by way of a notice exclude or limit his obligation to make reparation with respect to third persons; such a notice may, however, constitute disclosure of a danger. 1991, c. 64, a. 1476; I. N. 20140501. 1477. The assumption of risk by the victim, although it may be considered imprudent having regard to the circumstances, does not entail renunciation of his remedy against the author of the injury. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1296

1477; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY 1478. Where an injury has been caused by several persons, liability is shared between them in proportion to the seriousness of the fault of each. The victim is included in the apportionment when the injury is partly the effect of his own fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 1478; I. N. 20140501. 1479. A person who is bound to make reparation for an injury is not liable for any aggravation of the injury that the victim could have avoided.
### Chunk 1297

1991, c. 64, a. 1479; I. N. 20140501. 1480. Where several persons have jointly participated in a wrongful act or omission which has resulted in injury or have committed separate faults each of which may have caused the injury, and where it is impossible to determine, in either case, which of them actually caused the injury, they are solidarily bound to make reparation therefor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1480; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 184. 1481. Where an injury has been caused by several persons and one of them is exempted from all liability by an express provision of a special Act, the share of the liability which would have been his is assumed equally by the other persons liable for the injury.

1991, c. 64, a. 1481. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 297 of 556 ### Page 298 CHAPTER IV CERTAIN OTHER SOURCES OF OBLIGATIONS DIVISION I MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS OF ANOTHER 1482. Management of the business of another exists where a person, the manager, spontaneously and under no obligation to act, voluntarily and opportunely undertakes to manage the business of another, the principal, without his knowledge, or with his knowledge if he was unable to appoint a mandatary or otherwise provide for it.
### Chunk 1299

1991, c. 64, a. 1482. 1483. The manager shall as soon as possible inform the principal of the management he has undertaken. 1991, c. 64, a. 1483. 1484. The manager is bound to continue the management undertaken until he can withdraw without risk of loss or until the principal, or his tutor, mandatary or temporary representative, or the liquidator of the succession, as the case may be, is able to provide for it. The manager is, in all other aspects of his management, subject to the general obligations of an administrator of the property of another charged with simple administration, insofar as the obligations are not incompatible, having regard to the circumstances.
### Chunk 1300

1991, c. 64, a. 1484; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 11, s. 76. 1485. The liquidator of the succession of the manager who is aware of the management is bound to do only what is necessary to avoid loss in matters already begun; he shall immediately account to the principal. 1991, c. 64, a. 1485; I. N. 20140501. 1486. When the conditions of management of the business of another are fulfilled, even if the desired result has not been attained, the principal shall reimburse the manager for all the necessary or useful expenses he has incurred and indemnify him for any injury he has suffered by reason of his management and not through his own fault.
### Chunk 1301

The principal shall also fulfil any necessary or useful obligations that the manager has contracted with third persons in his name or for his benefit. 1991, c. 64, a. 1486. 1487. Expenses or obligations are assessed as to their necessity or usefulness at the time they were incurred or contracted by the manager. 1991, c. 64, a. 1487. 1488. Disbursements made by the manager with respect to an immovable belonging to the principal are treated as provided in the rules established for disbursements made by a possessor in good faith.
### Chunk 1302

1991, c. 64, a. 1488; I. N. 20140501. 1489. A manager acting in his own name is bound towards third persons with whom he contracts, without prejudice to his or their remedies against the principal. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 298 of 556 ### Page 299 A manager acting in the name of the principal is bound towards third persons with whom he contracts only if the principal is not bound towards them. 1991, c. 64, a. 1489; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1303

1490. Management inopportunely undertaken by a manager is binding on the principal only to the extent of his enrichment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1490. DIVISION II RECEIPT OF A PAYMENT NOT DUE 1991, c. 64, Div. II; I. N. 20140501. 1491. A payment made in error, or merely to avoid injury to the person making it while protesting that he owes nothing, obliges the person who receives it to make restitution. However, a person who receives the payment in good faith is not obliged to make restitution where, in consequence of the payment, the person’s claim is prescribed or the person has destroyed his title or relinquished a security, saving the remedy of the person having made the payment against the true debtor.
### Chunk 1304

1991, c. 64, a. 1491; 2016, c. 4, s. 185. 1492. Restitution of payments not due is made according to the rules for the restitution of prestations. 1991, c. 64, a. 1492; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III UNJUST ENRICHMENT 1493. A person who is enriched at the expense of another shall, to the extent of his enrichment, indemnify the other for the latter’s correlative impoverishment, if there is no justification for the enrichment or the impoverishment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1493; I.
### Chunk 1305

N. 20140501. 1494. Enrichment or impoverishment is justified where it results from the performance of an obligation, from the failure of the person impoverished to exercise a right of which he may avail himself or could have availed himself against the person enriched, or from an act performed by the person impoverished for his personal and exclusive interest or at his own risk and peril, or with a consistent liberal intention. 1991, c. 64, a. 1494; I. N. 20140501. 1495. The indemnity is due only if the enrichment continues to exist on the day of the demand.
### Chunk 1306

Both the enrichment and the impoverishment are assessed on the day of the demand; however, where the circumstances indicate the bad faith of the person enriched, the enrichment may be assessed as at the time he benefited therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 1495; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 299 of 556 ### Page 300 1496. Where the person enriched disposes of his enrichment gratuitously, with no intention of defrauding the person impoverished, the action of the person impoverished may be taken against the third person beneficiary if the latter could have known of the impoverishment.
### Chunk 1307

1991, c. 64, a. 1496. CHAPTER V MODALITIES OF OBLIGATIONS DIVISION I SIMPLE MODALITIES § 1. — Conditional obligations 1497. An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event, either by suspending it until the event occurs or is certain not to occur, or by making its extinction dependent on whether or not the event occurs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1497. 1498. An obligation is not conditional if it or its extinction depends on an event that, unknown to the parties, had already occurred at the time that the debtor obligated himself conditionally.
### Chunk 1308

1991, c. 64, a. 1498. 1499. A condition upon which an obligation depends is one that is possible and neither unlawful nor contrary to public order; otherwise, it is null and renders null the obligation that depends upon it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1499. 1500. An obligation that depends upon a condition that is at the sole discretion of the debtor is null; however, if the condition consists in doing or not doing something, the obligation is valid, even where the act is at the discretion of the debtor.
### Chunk 1309

1991, c. 64, a. 1500. 1501. If no time has been fixed for fulfillment of a condition, the condition may be fulfilled at any time; the condition fails, however, if it becomes certain that it will not be fulfilled. 1991, c. 64, a. 1501. 1502. Where an obligation is dependent on the condition that an event will not occur within a given time, the condition is considered fulfilled once the time has elapsed without the event having occurred, and also when, before the time has elapsed, it becomes certain that the event will not occur.
### Chunk 1310

Where no time has been fixed, the condition is not considered fulfilled until it becomes certain that the event will not occur. 1991, c. 64, a. 1502. 1503. A conditional obligation becomes absolute when the debtor whose obligation is subject to the condition prevents it from being fulfilled. 1991, c. 64, a. 1503. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 300 of 556 ### Page 301 1504. The creditor, pending fulfillment of the condition, may take any useful measures to preserve his rights.
### Chunk 1311

1991, c. 64, a. 1504. 1505. The conditional nature of an obligation does not prevent it from being transferable or transmissible. 1991, c. 64, a. 1505. 1506. The fulfillment of a condition has a retroactive effect, between the parties and with respect to third persons, to the day on which the debtor obligated himself conditionally. 1991, c. 64, a. 1506. 1507. The fulfillment of a suspensive condition obliges the debtor to perform the obligation, as though it had existed from the day on which he obligated himself under that condition.
### Chunk 1312

The fulfillment of a resolutory condition obliges each party to return to the other the prestations he has received pursuant to the obligation, as though the obligation had never existed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1507. § 2. — Obligations with a term 1508. An obligation with a suspensive term is an existing obligation that does not become exigible until the occurrence of a future and certain event. 1991, c. 64, a. 1508. 1509. Where the obligation does not become exigible until the expiry of a period of time but no specific date is mentioned, the first day of the period is not counted, but the day of its expiry is counted.
### Chunk 1313

1991, c. 64, a. 1509. 1510. If an event that was considered certain does not occur, the obligation is exigible from the day on which the event normally should have occurred. 1991, c. 64, a. 1510. 1511. A term is for the benefit of the debtor, unless it is apparent from the law, the intent of the parties or the circumstances that it has been stipulated for the benefit of the creditor or both parties. The party for whose exclusive benefit a term has been stipulated may renounce it, without the consent of the other party.
### Chunk 1314

1991, c. 64, a. 1511. 1512. Where the parties have agreed to delay the determination of the term or to leave it to one of them to make such determination and where, after a reasonable time, no term has been determined, the court may, upon the application of one of the parties, fix the term according to the nature of the obligation, the situation of the parties and any appropriate circumstances. The court may also fix the term where a term is required by the nature of the obligation and there is no agreement as to how it may be determined.
### Chunk 1315

1991, c. 64, a. 1512; 2016, c. 4, s. 186. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 301 of 556 ### Page 302 1513. What is due with a term may not be exacted before the term expires, but anything performed freely and without error before the expiry of the term may not be recovered. 1991, c. 64, a. 1513. 1514. A debtor loses the benefit of the term if he becomes insolvent, is declared bankrupt, or, by his own act or omission and without the consent of the creditor, reduces the security he has given to him.
### Chunk 1316

He also loses the benefit of the term if he fails to meet the conditions in consideration of which it was granted to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 1514; 2016, c. 4, s. 187. 1515. Renunciation of the benefit of the term or forfeiture of the term renders the obligation exigible immediately. 1991, c. 64, a. 1515. 1516. Forfeiture of the term incurred by one of the debtors, even a solidary debtor, may not be set up against the other codebtors. 1991, c. 64, a. 1516. 1517. An obligation with an extinctive term is an obligation which has a duration fixed by law or by the parties and which is extinguished by expiry of the term.
### Chunk 1317

1991, c. 64, a. 1517. DIVISION II COMPLEX MODALITIES § 1. — Obligations with multiple persons I. — Joint, divisible and indivisible obligations 1518. An obligation is joint between two or more debtors where they are obligated to the creditor for the same thing but in such a way that each debtor may only be compelled to perform the obligation separately and only up to his share of the debt. An obligation is joint between two or more creditors where each creditor may only exact the performance of his share of the claim from the common debtor.
### Chunk 1318

1991, c. 64, a. 1518. 1519. An obligation is divisible by operation of law, unless it is expressly stipulated that it is indivisible or unless the object of the obligation, owing to its nature, is not susceptible of division either materially or intellectually. 1991, c. 64, a. 1519. 1520. An indivisible obligation may not be divided, either between the creditors or the debtors or between their heirs. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 302 of 556 ### Page 303 Each debtor or each of his heirs may separately be compelled to perform the whole obligation and, conversely, each creditor or each of his heirs may exact the performance of the whole obligation, even though the obligation is not solidary.
### Chunk 1319

1991, c. 64, a. 1520; I. N. 20140501. 1521. A stipulation of solidarity does not, in itself, make an obligation indivisible. 1991, c. 64, a. 1521; 2016, c. 4, s. 188. 1522. A divisible obligation binding only one debtor and one creditor must be performed between them as if it were indivisible, but it remains divisible between their heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1522; I. N. 20140501. II. — Solidary obligations 1. — Solidarity between debtors 1523. An obligation is solidary between the debtors where they are obligated to the creditor for the same thing in such a way that each of them may be compelled separately to perform the whole obligation and where performance by a single debtor releases the others towards the creditor.
### Chunk 1320

1991, c. 64, a. 1523. 1524. An obligation may be solidary even though one of the codebtors is obliged differently from the others to perform the same thing, such as where one is conditionally bound while the obligation of the other is not conditional, or where one is allowed a term which is not granted to the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 1524. 1525. Solidarity between debtors is not presumed; it exists only where it is expressly stipulated by the parties or provided for by law. Solidarity between debtors is presumed, however, where an obligation is contracted for the service or operation of an enterprise.
### Chunk 1321

The carrying on by one or more persons of an organized economic activity, whether or not it is commercial in nature, consisting of producing, administering or alienating property, or providing a service, constitutes the operation of an enterprise. 1991, c. 64, a. 1525; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1526. The obligation to make reparation for injury caused to another through the fault of two or more persons is solidary where the obligation is extracontractual. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1322

1526. 1527. Where specific performance of an obligation has become impossible through the fault of one or more of the solidary debtors, or at a time when one or more of the solidary debtors are in default, the other co debtors are not discharged from their obligation to make an equivalent payment to the creditor, but they are not liable for additional damages which may be owed to him. The creditor may not claim additional damages except from those codebtors through whose fault the obligation became impossible to perform, and from those who were then in default for failing to perform it.
### Chunk 1323

1991, c. 64, a. 1527; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 303 of 556 ### Page 304 1528. The creditor of a solidary obligation may apply for payment to any one of the codebtors at his option, without such debtor having a right to plead the benefit of division. 1991, c. 64, a. 1528. 1529. An action instituted against one of the solidary debtors does not deprive the creditor of his remedy against the others, but the debtor sued may implead the other solidary debtors.
### Chunk 1324

1991, c. 64, a. 1529; 2014, c. 1, s. 789. 1530. A solidary debtor who is sued by his creditor may set up all the defenses that are personal to the debtor, as well as those that are common to all the codebtors, but he may not set up defenses that are purely personal to one or several of the other codebtors. 1991, c. 64, a. 1530; I. N. 20140501. 1531. Where, through the act or omission of the creditor, a solidary debtor is deprived of a security or of a right which he could have set up by subrogation, he is released to the extent of the value of the security or right of which he is deprived.
### Chunk 1325

1991, c. 64, a. 1531; 2016, c. 4, s. 189. 1532. A creditor who renounces solidarity with regard to one of the debtors retains his solidary remedy against the other debtors for the whole debt. 1991, c. 64, a. 1532; I. N. 20140501. 1533. A creditor who receives separately and without reserve the share of one of the solidary debtors and specifies in the acquittance that it applies to that share renounces solidarity with regard to that debtor alone. 1991, c. 64, a. 1533; I.
### Chunk 1326

N. 20140501. 1534. Where a creditor receives separately and without reserve the share of one of the debtors in the periodic payments or interest on the debt and specifies in the acquittance that it applies to his share, he loses his solidary remedy against that debtor for the periodic payments or interest due, but not for any that may become due in the future, nor for the capital, unless separate payment is continued for three consecutive years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1534. 1535. A creditor who sues a solidary debtor for his share loses his solidary remedy against him if the debtor acquiesces in the demand or is condemned by judgment.
### Chunk 1327

1991, c. 64, a. 1535. 1536. A solidary debtor who has performed the obligation may not recover from his codebtors more than their respective shares, although he is subrogated to the rights of the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1536. 1537. Contribution to the payment of a solidary obligation is made by equal shares among the solidary debtors, unless their interests in the debt, including their shares of the obligation to make reparation for injury caused to another, are unequal, in which case their contributions are proportional to the interest of each in the debt.
### Chunk 1328

However, if the obligation was contracted in the exclusive interest of one of the debtors or if it is due to the fault of one codebtor alone, he is liable for the whole debt to the other codebtors, who are then considered, in his regard, as his sureties. 1991, c. 64, a. 1537. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 304 of 556 ### Page 305 1538. A loss arising from the insolvency of a solidary debtor is equally divided between the other co debtors, unless their interests in the debt are unequal.
### Chunk 1329

A creditor who has renounced solidarity with regard to one debtor, however, bears the share of that debtor in the contribution. 1991, c. 64, a. 1538; I. N. 20140501. 1539. A solidary debtor sued for reimbursement by the codebtor who has performed the obligation may raise any common defenses that have not been set up by the codebtor against the creditor. He may also set up defenses which are personal to himself, but not those which are purely personal to one or several of the other codebtors.
### Chunk 1330

1991, c. 64, a. 1539. 1540. The obligation of a solidary debtor is divided by operation of law between his heirs, except where it is indivisible. 1991, c. 64, a. 1540. 2. — Solidarity between creditors 1541. Solidarity between creditors exists only where it has been expressly stipulated. It entitles each of them to exact the whole performance of the obligation from the debtor and to give a full acquittance for it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1541. 1542. Performance of an obligation in favour of one of the solidary creditors releases the debtor towards the other creditors.
### Chunk 1331

1991, c. 64, a. 1542. 1543. A debtor has the option of performing the obligation in favour of any of the solidary creditors, provided he has not been sued by any of them. A release from the obligation granted by one of the solidary creditors releases the debtor, but only for the portion of that creditor. The same rule applies to all cases in which the obligation is extinguished otherwise than by payment thereof. 1991, c. 64, a. 1543. 1544. An obligation for the benefit of a solidary creditor is divided by operation of law between his heirs.
### Chunk 1332

1991, c. 64, a. 1544. § 2. — Obligations with multiple objects I. — Alternative obligations 1545. An alternative obligation is one which has two principal prestations as its object, the performance of either of which releases the debtor for the whole. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 305 of 556 ### Page 306 An obligation is not considered to be alternative if, when it arose, one of the prestations could not be the object of the obligation.
### Chunk 1333

1991, c. 64, a. 1545. 1546. The choice of the prestation belongs to the debtor, unless it has been expressly granted to the creditor. Where the party who has the choice of the prestation fails to exercise that choice, after receiving a demand requiring him to do so, within the time alloted to him, the choice of the prestation passes to the other party. 1991, c. 64, a. 1546; I. N. 20151101. 1547. A debtor may neither perform nor be compelled to perform part of one prestation and part of the other.
### Chunk 1334

1991, c. 64, a. 1547. 1548. Where the debtor has the choice of the prestation and one of the prestations becomes impossible to perform, even through his own fault, he shall perform the one that remains. If, in the same case, both prestations become impossible to perform and the impossibility of performing either of them is due to the fault of the debtor, he is liable to the creditor to the extent of the value of the last prestation remaining. 1991, c. 64, a. 1548; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1335

1549. Where the creditor has the choice of the prestation, he shall, if one of the prestations becomes impossible to perform, accept the remaining prestation unless the impossibility of performing it is due to the fault of the debtor, in which case the creditor has the right to exact specific performance of the remaining prestation, or reparation, by equivalence, for the injury resulting from the nonperformance of the prestation that has become impossible. If, in the same case, the prestations become impossible to perform and the impossibility of performing them is due to the fault of the debtor, the creditor may exact reparation, by equivalence, for the injury resulting from the nonperformance of either of the prestations.
### Chunk 1336

1991, c. 64, a. 1549; I. N. 20140501. 1550. Where all the prestations become impossible to perform through no fault of the debtor, the obligation is extinguished. 1991, c. 64, a. 1550. 1551. The obligation is an alternative obligation even where it has more than two principal prestations as its object, and the rules of this subdivision apply, adapted as required, to all such obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 1551. II. — Facultative obligations 1552. A facultative obligation is an obligation which has only one principal prestation as its object but from which the debtor may release himself by performing another prestation.
### Chunk 1337

The debtor is released if the principal prestation, through no fault on his part, becomes impossible to perform. 1991, c. 64, a. 1552. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 306 of 556 ### Page 307 CHAPTER VI PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS DIVISION I PAYMENT § 1. — Payment in general 1553. Payment means not only the turning over of a sum of money in satisfaction of an obligation, but also the actual performance of whatever forms the object of the obligation.
### Chunk 1338

1991, c. 64, a. 1553. 1554. Every payment presupposes an obligation; what has been paid where there is no obligation may be recovered. Recovery is not admitted, however, in the case of natural obligations that have been voluntarily paid. 1991, c. 64, a. 1554. 1555. Payment may be made by any person, even if he is a third person with respect to the obligation; the creditor may be put in default by the offer of a third person to perform the obligation in the name of the debtor, provided the offer is made for the benefit of the debtor and not merely to change creditors.
### Chunk 1339

A creditor may not be compelled to take payment from a third person, however, if he has an interest in the payment being made by the debtor personally. 1991, c. 64, a. 1555; I. N. 20140501. 1556. A valid payment may only be made by a person having a right in the thing due which entitles him to give it in payment. However, payment of a sum of money or of any other thing due that is consumed by use may not be recovered against a creditor who has used it in good faith, even though it was made by a person who was not authorized to make it.
### Chunk 1340

1991, c. 64, a. 1556. 1557. Payment shall be made to the creditor or to a person authorized to receive it for him. Payment made to a third person is valid if the creditor ratifies it; if it is not ratified, the payment is valid only to the extent of the benefit that the creditor derives from it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1557; I. N. 20140501. 1558. Payment made to a creditor without capacity to receive it is valid only to the extent of the benefit he derives from it. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1341

1558. 1559. Payment made in good faith to the apparent creditor is valid, even though it is subsequently established that he is not the rightful creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1559. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 307 of 556 ### Page 308 1560. Payment made by a debtor to his creditor to the detriment of a seizing creditor is not valid against the seizing creditor who, according to his rights, may compel the debtor to pay again; in that case, the debtor has a remedy against the creditor so paid.
### Chunk 1342

1991, c. 64, a. 1560. 1561. A creditor may not be compelled to accept anything other than what is due to him, even though what is offered is of greater value. Nor may he be compelled to accept partial payment of an obligation unless the obligation is disputed in part. In that case, if the debtor offers to pay the undisputed part, the creditor may not refuse to accept payment of it, but he retains his right to claim the other part of the obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1561; I. N.
### Chunk 1343

20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 190. 1562. A debtor of certain and determinate property is released by the handing over of the property in its actual condition at the time of payment, provided that the deterioration it has suffered is not due to his act, omission or fault and did not occur after he was in default for the payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1562; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 191. 1563. Where the property is determinate as to its kind only, the debtor need not give the best quality, but he may not offer the worst quality.
### Chunk 1344

1991, c. 64, a. 1563; I. N. 20140501. 1564. Where the debt consists of a sum of money, the debtor is released by paying the nominal amount due in money which is legal tender at the time of payment. He is also released by remitting the amount due by money order, by cheque made to the order of the creditor and certified by a financial institution carrying on business in Québec, or by any other instrument of payment offering the same guarantees to the creditor, or, if the creditor is in a position to accept it, by means of a credit card or a transfer of funds to an account of the creditor in a financial institution.
### Chunk 1345

1991, c. 64, a. 1564. 1565. Interest is paid at the agreed rate or, if none, at the legal rate. 1991, c. 64, a. 1565. 1566. Payment is made at the place expressly or impliedly indicated by the parties. If no place is indicated by the parties, payment is made at the domicile of the debtor, unless what is due is certain and determinate property, in which case payment is made at the place where the property was when the obligation arose. 1991, c. 64, a. 1566; I. N. 20140501.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 308 of 556 ### Page 309 § 2. — Imputation of payment 1569. When making payment, a debtor who owes several debts has the right to impute payment to the debt he intends to pay.
### Chunk 1347

He may not, however, without the consent of the creditor, impute payment to a debt not yet due in preference to a debt which has become due, unless it was agreed that payment may be made by anticipation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1569. 1570. A debtor who owes a debt that bears interest or yields periodic payments may not, without the consent of the creditor, impute a payment to the capital in preference to the interest or periodic payments. Any partial payment made on the principal and interest is imputed first to the interest.
### Chunk 1348

1991, c. 64, a. 1570. 1571. Where a debtor who owes several debts has accepted an acquittance by which the creditor, at the time of payment, imputed payment to one specific debt, he may not subsequently require that it be imputed to a different debt, except upon grounds for which contracts may be annulled. 1991, c. 64, a. 1571. 1572. In the absence of imputation by the parties, payment is imputed first to the debt that is due. Where several debts are due, payment is imputed to the debt which the debtor has the greatest interest in paying.
### Chunk 1349

Where the debtor has the same interest in paying several debts, payment is imputed to the debt that became due first; if all of the debts became due at the same time, however, payment is imputed proportionately. 1991, c. 64, a. 1572. § 3. — Tender and deposit 1573. Where a creditor refuses or neglects to accept payment, the debtor may make a tender. A tender consists in placing the property that is due at the disposal of the creditor at the place and time that payment is due. In addition to the property due, with the interest and periodic payments it has yielded, a reasonable amount to cover unliquidated expenses owed by the debtor shall be included, saving the right to make up any deficiency in that amount.
### Chunk 1350

1991, c. 64, a. 1573; I. N. 20140501. 1574. Where the object tendered is a sum of money, it may be tendered in currency which is legal tender at the time of payment or by cheque made to the order of the creditor and certified by a financial institution carrying on business in Québec. Tender may also be made by way of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking, for an indefinite term, by a financial institution carrying on business in Québec, to pay to the creditor the amount tendered if the creditor accepts the tender or if the court declares it valid.
### Chunk 1351

1991, c. 64, a. 1574. 1575. Tender may be made by notarial act en minute or by a judicial declaration which is recorded; it may also be made by any other writing or in any other manner, provided it is proved. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 309 of 556 ### Page 310 Where tender is made by notarial act, the notary records the answer of the creditor in the act and, in case of refusal, the reasons given by him. 1991, c. 64, a. 1575; 1992, c.
### Chunk 1352

57, s. 716; 2016, c. 4, s. 192. 1576. The tender of a sum of money or securities made by a judicial declaration shall be completed by deposit of the sum or the securities, in accordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). 1991, c. 64, a. 1576; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 193. 1577. Where payment or delivery of the property is to be made at the domicile of the debtor or at the place where the property is located, a written notice given to the creditor by the debtor that he is ready to perform the obligation there has the same effect as a tender.
### Chunk 1353

Where payment or delivery of the property need not be so made and it is difficult to transport the property to the place where it is to be made, the debtor may, in writing, require the creditor to advise him of his willingness to accept the property if he has reason to believe that the creditor will refuse it; if the creditor fails to advise the debtor of his willingness in due time, the debtor need not transport the property to the place where it is to be paid or delivered and his notice to the creditor has the same effect as a tender.
### Chunk 1354

1991, c. 64, a. 1577; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. 1578. Where the property which is due is a sum of money or securities, a written notice given by the debtor to the creditor that the sum of money or the securities are deposited has the same effect as a tender. 1991, c. 64, a. 1578; I. N. 20140501. 1579. In every tender, or notice having the same effect, the nature of the debt, the title under which it was created and the name of the creditor or the persons to whom payment is to be made shall be indicated; in addition, a description of the property tendered shall be included with, in the case of a sum of money in cash, an enumeration of each denomination.
### Chunk 1355

1991, c. 64, a. 1579; I. N. 20140501. 1580. A creditor is in default by operation of law for not receiving payment where, without justification, he refuses a valid tender, where he refuses to act on the notice having the same effect, or where he clearly expresses his intention to refuse any tender that the debtor might wish to make; in this last case, the debtor need not make any tender or give any notice having the same effect. A creditor is also in default by operation of law where the debtor, despite his diligence, cannot find him.
### Chunk 1356

1991, c. 64, a. 1580; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1581. Where the creditor is in default for not receiving payment, the debtor may take any measures necessary or useful for the preservation of the property which he owes and, in particular, entrust it to a third person for storage or custody. In the same case, if the property is perishable, likely to depreciate rapidly or expensive to preserve, the debtor may cause it to be sold and deposit the proceeds. 1991, c. 64, a. 1581; I.
### Chunk 1357

N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1582. A creditor who is in default for not receiving payment bears the reasonable costs of preservation of the property, as well as any costs that may be incurred for the sale of the property and the deposit of the proceeds. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 310 of 556 ### Page 311 He also bears the risks of loss of the property by superior force. 1991, c. 64, a. 1582; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1583.
### Chunk 1358

Deposit by the debtor of the sum of money or the securities which he owes is made in the general deposit office for Québec or any trust company authorized under the Trust Companies and Savings Companies Act (chapter S29. 02) or, during judicial proceedings, in accordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). Deposit may be made not only where the creditor refuses to accept the money or securities owed by the debtor, but also, among other cases, where the claim is in dispute between several persons or where the debtor is prevented from making payment by reason of the fact that the creditor cannot be found at the place where the payment is to be made.
### Chunk 1359

1991, c. 64, a. 1583; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2018, c. 23, s. 714. 1584. A debtor may withdraw a sum of money or securities which he has deposited, so long as the deposit has not been accepted by the creditor; if he withdraws it, neither his codebtors nor his sureties are released. No withdrawal may be made during judicial proceedings, however, except by authorization of the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 1584; I. N. 20140501. 1585. Where the deposit of a sum of money or of securities is declared valid by the court, the debtor may not withdraw the deposit except with the consent of the creditor.
### Chunk 1360

Such a withdrawal may not, however, impair the rights of third persons or prevent the release of the co debtors or the sureties of the debtor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1585; I. N. 20140501. 1586. A deposit made according to the conditions set forth in the preceding articles releases the debtor, for the future, from the payment of interest or income yielded. 1991, c. 64, a. 1586. 1587. Interest or income yielded from the date of deposit belongs to the creditor. Nevertheless, where the deposit is made to obtain the performance of an obligation of the creditor that is correlative to the obligation the debtor intends to perform by the deposit, the interest or income belongs to the debtor until the deposit is accepted by the creditor.
### Chunk 1361

1991, c. 64, a. 1587. 1588. A tender accepted by the creditor or declared valid by the court is equivalent, with respect to the debtor, to payment made on the day of the tender or of the notice having the same effect, provided the debtor has always been willing to pay from that time. 1991, c. 64, a. 1588; I. N. 20140501. 1589. Where tender and deposit are accepted or declared valid by the court, the expenses related to them are borne by the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1589.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 311 of 556 ### Page 312 DIVISION II RIGHT TO ENFORCE PERFORMANCE § 1. — General provision 1590. An obligation confers on the creditor the right to demand that the obligation be performed in full, properly and without delay. Where the debtor fails to perform his obligation without justification on his part and he is in default, the creditor may, without prejudice to his right to the performance of the obligation in whole or in part by equivalence, (1) force specific performance of the obligation; (2) obtain, in the case of a contractual obligation, the resolution or resiliation of the contract or the reduction of his own correlative obligation; (3) take any other measure provided by law to enforce his right to the performance of the obligation.
### Chunk 1363

1991, c. 64, a. 1590. § 2. — Exception for nonperformance and right of retention 1591. Where the obligations arising from a synallagmatic contract are exigible and one of the parties fails to perform his obligation to a substantial degree or does not offer to perform it, the other party may refuse to perform his correlative obligation to a corresponding degree, unless he is bound by law, the will of the parties or usage to perform first. 1991, c. 64, a. 1591. 1592. A party who, with the consent of the other contracting party, has detention of property belonging to the latter has a right to retain it pending full payment of his claim against him, if the claim is exigible and is closely related to the property of which he has detention.
### Chunk 1364

1991, c. 64, a. 1592; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1593. The right of retention may be set up against anyone. Involuntary dispossession does not extinguish a right of retention; the party exercising the right may revendicate the property, subject to the rules on prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 1593. § 3. — Default 1594. A debtor may be in default for failing to perform the obligation owing to the terms of the contract itself, when it contains a stipulation that the mere lapse of time for performing it will have that effect.
### Chunk 1365

A debtor may also be put in default by an extrajudicial demand to perform the obligation addressed to him by his creditor, a judicial application filed against him or the sole operation of law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1594; I. N. 20151101. 1595. An extrajudicial demand by which a creditor puts his debtor in default must be made in writing. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 312 of 556 ### Page 313 The demand must allow the debtor sufficient time for performance, having regard to the nature of the obligation and the circumstances; otherwise the debtor may perform the obligation within a reasonable time after the demand.
### Chunk 1366

1991, c. 64, a. 1595; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1596. Where a creditor files a judicial application against the debtor without his otherwise being in default, the debtor is entitled to perform the obligation within a reasonable time after the demand. If the obligation is performed within a reasonable time, the costs of the demand are borne by the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1596; I. N. 20151101. 1597. A debtor is in default by the sole operation of law where the performance of the obligation would have been useful only within a certain time which he allowed to expire or where he failed to perform the obligation immediately despite the urgency that he do so.
### Chunk 1367

A debtor is also in default by operation of law where he has violated an obligation not to do, or where specific performance of the obligation has become impossible through his fault, and also where he has made clear to the creditor his intention not to perform the obligation or where, in the case of an obligation of successive performance, he has repeatedly refused or neglected to perform it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1597. 1598. The creditor shall prove the occurrence of one of the cases of default by operation of law notwithstanding any statement or stipulation to the contrary.
### Chunk 1368

1991, c. 64, a. 1598. 1599. An extrajudicial demand by which the creditor puts one of the solidary debtors in default has effect with respect to the other debtors. Similarly, an extrajudicial demand made by one of the solidary creditors has effect with respect to the other creditors. 1991, c. 64, a. 1599. 1600. Where the subject of the obligation is a sum of money, the debtor, although he may be granted a period of grace, is liable for injury resulting from delay in the performance of the obligation from the moment he is in default.
### Chunk 1369

The debtor in such a case is also liable from the same moment for any loss resulting from superior force, unless he is released thereby from his obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1600; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 4. — Specific performance 1601. A creditor may, in cases which admit of it, demand that the debtor be forced to make specific performance of the obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1601. 1602. Where the debtor is in default, the creditor may perform the obligation or cause it to be performed at the expense of the debtor.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 313 of 556 ### Page 314 A creditor wishing to avail himself of this right shall so notify the debtor in the judicial application or the extrajudicial demand by which he puts him in default, except in cases where the debtor is in default by operation of law or by the terms of the contract itself. 1991, c. 64, a. 1602; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1603. The creditor may be authorized to destroy or remove, at the expense of the debtor, what has been done by the debtor in violation of an obligation not to do.
### Chunk 1371

1991, c. 64, a. 1603; I. N. 20140501. § 5. — Resolution or resiliation of contracts and reduction of obligations 1604. Where the creditor does not avail himself of the right to force the specific performance of the contractual obligation of the debtor in cases which admit of it, he is entitled either to the resolution of the contract, or to its resiliation in the case of a contract of successive performance. However and notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, he is not entitled to resolution or resiliation of the contract if the default of the debtor is of minor importance, unless, in the case of an obligation of successive performance, the default occurs repeatedly, but he is then entitled to a proportional reduction of his correlative obligation.
### Chunk 1372

All the relevant circumstances are taken into consideration in assessing the proportional reduction of the correlative obligation. If the obligation cannot be reduced, the creditor is entitled to damages only. 1991, c. 64, a. 1604. 1605. A contract may be resolved or resiliated without judicial action where the debtor is in default by operation of law for failing to perform his obligation or where he has failed to perform it within the time set in the demand putting him in default.
### Chunk 1373

1991, c. 64, a. 1605; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2014, c. 1, s. 790. 1606. A contract which is resolved is deemed never to have existed; each party is, in such a case, bound to restore to the other the prestations he has already received. A contract which is resiliated ceases to exist, but only for the future. 1991, c. 64, a. 1606. § 6. — Performance by equivalence I. — General provisions 1607. The creditor is entitled to damages for bodily, moral or material injury which is an immediate and direct consequence of the debtor’s default.
### Chunk 1374

1991, c. 64, a. 1607. 1608. The obligation of the debtor to pay damages to the creditor is neither reduced nor altered by the fact that the creditor receives a benefit from a third person, as a result of the injury he has suffered, except so far as the third person is subrogated to the rights of the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1608; I. N. 20140501. 1609. Acquittances, transactions or statements which the debtor, an insurer or their representatives obtain from the creditor, and which relate to the bodily or moral injury the creditor has suffered, are without effect if CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 314 of 556 ### Page 315 they are damaging to the creditor and were obtained within 30 days of the act or omission which caused the injury.
### Chunk 1375

1991, c. 64, a. 1609; 2016, c. 4, s. 194. 1610. The right of a creditor to damages, including punitive damages, may be assigned or transmitted. This rule does not apply where the right of the creditor results from the infringement of a personality right; in such a case, the right of the creditor to damages may not be assigned, and may be transmitted only to his heirs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1610; I. N. 20140501. II. — Assessment of damages 1. — Assessment in general 1611.
### Chunk 1376

The damages due to the creditor compensate for the amount of the loss he has sustained and the profit of which he has been deprived. Future injury which is certain and assessable is taken into account in awarding damages. 1991, c. 64, a. 1611; I. N. 20140501. 1612. The loss sustained by the owner of a trade secret includes the investment expenses incurred for its acquisition, perfection and use; the profit of which he is deprived may be compensated for through payment of royalties.
### Chunk 1377

1991, c. 64, a. 1612; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. 1613. In contractual matters, the debtor is liable only for damages that were foreseen or foreseeable at the time the obligation was contracted, where the failure to perform the obligation does not proceed from intentional or gross fault on his part; even then, the damages include only what is an immediate and direct consequence of the nonperformance. 1991, c. 64, a. 1613. 1614. Damages owed to the creditor for bodily injury he suffers are measured as to the future aspects of the injury according to the discount rates set by regulation of the Government, from the time such rates are set.
### Chunk 1378

1991, c. 64, a. 1614; I. N. 20140501. 1615. The court, in awarding damages for bodily injury, may, for a period of not more than three years, reserve the right of the creditor to apply for additional damages, if the course of his physical condition cannot be determined with sufficient precision at the time of the judgment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1615; I. N. 20140501. 1616. Damages awarded for injury are exigible in the form of capital payable all at once, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
### Chunk 1379

Where the injury suffered is bodily injury and where the creditor is a minor, however, the court may order payment, in whole or in part, in the form of an annuity or by periodic instalments, on the terms and conditions it fixes, which may include indexation according to a fixed rate. Within three months after the date on which CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 315 of 556 ### Page 316 the creditor attains full age, he may demand immediate and discounted payment of any amount still receivable.

1991, c. 64, a. 1616; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 195. 1617. Damages which result from delay in the performance of an obligation to pay a sum of money consist of interest at the agreed rate or, in the absence of any agreement, at the legal rate. The creditor is entitled to the damages from the date of default without having to prove that he has suffered any injury. A creditor may stipulate, however, that he will be entitled to additional damages, provided he justifies them.
### Chunk 1381

1991, c. 64, a. 1617; I. N. 20140501. 1618. Damages other than those resulting from delay in the performance of an obligation to pay a sum of money bear interest at the rate agreed by the parties, or, in the absence of agreement, at the legal rate, from the date of default or from any other later date which the court considers appropriate, having regard to the nature of the injury and the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1618. 1619. An indemnity may be added to the amount of damages awarded for any reason, which is fixed by applying to the amount of the damages, from either of the dates used in computing the interest on them, a percentage equal to the excess of the rate of interest fixed for claims of the State under section 28 of the Tax Administration Act (chapter A6.
### Chunk 1382

002) over the rate of interest agreed by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, over the legal rate. 1991, c. 64, a. 1619; 2010, c. 31, s. 175. 1620. Interest accrued on principal does not itself bear interest except where that is provided by agreement or by law or where additional interest is expressly demanded in a suit. 1991, c. 64, a. 1620. 1621. Where the awarding of punitive damages is provided for by law, the amount of such damages may not exceed what is sufficient to fulfil their preventive purpose.
### Chunk 1383

Punitive damages are assessed in the light of all the appropriate circumstances, in particular the gravity of the debtor’s fault, his patrimonial situation, the extent of the reparation for which he is already liable to the creditor and, where such is the case, the fact that the payment of the reparatory damages is wholly or partly assumed by a third person. 1991, c. 64, a. 1621; I. N. 20151101. 2. — Advance assessment of damages 1991, c. 64, Sd. 2; I. N. 20140501. 1622. A penal clause is one by which the parties assess the damages in advance, stipulating that the debtor will suffer a penalty if he fails to perform his obligation.
### Chunk 1384

A creditor has the right to avail himself of a penal clause instead of enforcing, in cases which admit of it, the specific performance of the obligation; but in no case may he exact both the performance and the penalty, unless the penalty has been stipulated for mere delay in the performance of the obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1622; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 316 of 556 ### Page 317 1623. A creditor who avails himself of a penal clause is entitled to the amount of the stipulated penalty without having to prove the injury he has suffered.
### Chunk 1385

However, the amount of the stipulated penalty may be reduced if the creditor has benefited from partial performance of the obligation or if the clause is abusive. 1991, c. 64, a. 1623. 1624. Where an obligation with a penal clause is indivisible without being solidary and its nonperformance is due to the act or omission of only one of the codebtors, the penalty may be exacted in full against him or against each of the codebtors for his share, but, in the latter case, without prejudice to their remedy against the codebtor who caused the penalty to be incurred.
### Chunk 1386

1991, c. 64, a. 1624; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. 1625. Where an obligation with a penal clause is divisible, the penalty also is divisible and is incurred only by that debtor who fails to perform the obligation, and only for that share of the obligation for which he is bound, without there being any action against those who have performed it. This rule does not apply where the obligation is solidary, nor where the penal clause was stipulated to prevent partial payment and one of the codebtors has prevented the performance of the obligation for the whole; in this case, that codebtor is liable for the whole penalty and the others are liable for their respective shares only, without prejudice to their remedy against him.

A creditor whose claim is certain, liquid and exigible may, in the debtor’s name, exercise the rights and actions of the debtor where the debtor, to the prejudice of the creditor, refuses or neglects to exercise them.

However, he may not exercise rights and actions which are strictly personal to the debtor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1627; I. N. 20140501. 1628. It is not necessary for the claim to be liquid and exigible at the time the action is instituted, but it is necessary that it be so at the time judgment is rendered. 1991, c. 64, a. 1628. 1629. The person against whom an oblique action is brought may set up against the creditor all the defenses he could have set up against his own creditor.

Property recovered by a creditor in the name of the debtor falls into the patrimony of the debtor and benefits all his creditors. 1991, c. 64, a. 1630. § 3. — Paulian action 1631. A creditor who suffers injury through a juridical act made by his debtor in fraud of his rights, in particular an act by which the debtor renders or seeks to render himself insolvent, or by which, being insolvent, he grants preference to another creditor, may obtain a declaration that the act may not be set up against him.
### Chunk 1390

1991, c. 64, a. 1631; I. N. 20140501. 1632. An onerous contract or a payment made in performance of such a contract is deemed to be made with fraudulent intent if the other contracting party or the creditor knew the debtor to be insolvent or knew that the debtor, by the juridical act, was rendering himself or was seeking to render himself insolvent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1632; I. N. 20140501. 1633. A gratuitous contract or a payment made in performance of such a contract is deemed to be made with fraudulent intent, even if the other contracting party or the creditor was unaware of the facts, where the debtor is or becomes insolvent at the time the contract is formed or the payment is made.
### Chunk 1391

1991, c. 64, a. 1633; I. N. 20140501. 1634. The claim must be certain at the time the action is instituted, and must be liquid and exigible at the time the judgment is rendered. The claim must exist prior to the juridical act which is attacked, unless that act was made for the purpose of defrauding a subsequent creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1634; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 196. 1635. The action is forfeited unless it is brought within one year from the day on which the creditor learned of the injury resulting from the act which is attacked, or, where the action is brought by a trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of all the creditors, from the date of appointment of the trustee.
### Chunk 1392

1991, c. 64, a. 1635. 1636. Where it is declared that a juridical act may not be set up against the creditor, it may not be set up against any other creditors who were entitled to institute the action and who intervened in it to protect their rights; all may have the property forming the subject of the juridical act seized and sold and may be paid in proportion to their claims, subject to the rights of prior or hypothecary creditors. 1991, c. 64, a. 1636; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c.

A creditor may assign to a third person all or part of a claim or a right of action which he has against his debtor. He may not, however, make an assignment that is injurious to the rights of the debtor or that renders his obligation more onerous. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1394

64, a. 1637. 1638. The assignment of a claim includes its accessories. 1991, c. 64, a. 1638. 1639. Where the assignment is by onerous title, the assignor warrants that the claim exists and is owed to him, even if the assignment is made without warranty, unless the assignee has acquired it at his own risk or knew of the uncertain nature of the claim at the time of the assignment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1639; I. N. 20140501. 1640. Where the assignor by onerous title guarantees the solvency of the debtor by a simple clause of warranty, he is liable for the solvency only at the time of the assignment and to the extent of the price he received.
### Chunk 1395

1991, c. 64, a. 1640. 1641. An assignment may be set up against the debtor and third persons as soon as the debtor has acquiesced in it or received a copy or a pertinent extract of the act of assignment or any other evidence of the assignment which may be set up against the assignor. If the debtor cannot be found in Québec, the assignment may be set up against the debtor and third persons upon the publication of a notice in accordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 1396

01) for notification by public notice. 1991, c. 64, a. 1641; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 791. 1642. The assignment of a universality of claims, present or future, may be set up against debtors and third persons by the registration of the assignment in the register of personal and movable real rights, provided, however, that the other formalities whereby the assignment may be set up against the debtors who have not acquiesced in it have been observed.
### Chunk 1397

1991, c. 64, a. 1642; I. N. 20151101. 1643. A debtor may set up against the assignee any payment made to the assignor before the assignment could be set up against him, as well as any other cause of extinction of the obligation that occurred before that time. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 319 of 556 ### Page 320 A debtor may also set up any payment made in good faith by himself or his surety to an apparent creditor, even if the required formalities whereby the assignment may be set up against the debtor and third persons have been observed.
### Chunk 1398

1991, c. 64, a. 1643; I. N. 20151101. 1644. Where a copy or an extract of the act of assignment or any other evidence of the assignment which may be set up against an assignor is handed over to the debtor at the time of service of an action brought against the debtor, no legal costs may be exacted from the debtor if he pays within the time fixed for answering the summons, unless he was already in default for failing to perform the obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1644; 1992, c. 57, s.
### Chunk 1399

716; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2014, c. 1, s. 792. 1645. The assignment may not be set up against the surety unless the prescribed formalities for the setting up of the assignment against the debtor have been observed with respect to the surety himself. 1991, c. 64, a. 1645; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1646. The assignees of the same claim, and the assignor with respect to any remainder due to him, are paid in proportion to the value of their claims. However, persons having obtained an assignment with a warranty of payment are paid in preference to all other assignees and to the assignor, and, among themselves, in the order of the dates on which their respective assignments could be set up against the debtor.
### Chunk 1400

1991, c. 64, a. 1646; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Assignment of claims attested by bearer instrument 1647. It is of the essence of a claim attested by a bearer instrument issued by a debtor that it may be assigned by mere delivery, to another bearer, of the instrument attesting it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1647. 1648. A debtor who has issued a bearer instrument is bound to pay the debt attested thereby to any bearer who hands over the instrument to him, except where he has received notification of a judgment ordering him to withhold payment thereof.
### Chunk 1401

He may not set up any defenses against the bearer other than defenses concerning the nullity of or a defect in the instrument, those founded on an express stipulation in the instrument or such defenses as he may raise against the bearer personally. 1991, c. 64, a. 1648; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 198. 1649. A debtor who has issued a bearer instrument remains bound towards every bearer in good faith, even if the debtor shows that the instrument was negotiated against his will.
### Chunk 1402

1991, c. 64, a. 1649. 1650. A person who has been unjustly dispossessed of a bearer instrument may not prevent the debtor from paying the claim to the person who presents the instrument except on notification of an order of the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 1650; 2016, c. 4, s. 199. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 320 of 556 ### Page 321 DIVISION II SUBROGATION 1651. A person who pays in the place of a debtor may be subrogated to the rights of the creditor.
### Chunk 1403

He does not have more rights than the subrogating creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1651. 1652. Subrogation may be conventional or legal. 1991, c. 64, a. 1652. 1653. Conventional subrogation may be made by the creditor or the debtor, but it must be made expressly and in writing. 1991, c. 64, a. 1653; I. N. 20140501. 1654. Subrogation may be made by the creditor only at the same time as he receives payment. It takes effect without the consent of the debtor, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.
### Chunk 1404

1991, c. 64, a. 1654. 1655. Subrogation may not be made by a debtor in favour of anyone except his lender and it takes effect without the consent of the creditor. In order for subrogation to be valid in this case, the loan instrument and the acquittance shall each be made in the form of a notarial act en minute or by a private writing drawn up before two witnesses who sign it. In addition, a statement shall be made in the loan instrument that the loan is granted for the purpose of paying the debt, and, in the acquittance, that the debt is paid out of the loan.
### Chunk 1405

1991, c. 64, a. 1655. 1656. Subrogation takes place by the sole operation of law (1) in favour of a creditor who pays another creditor whose claim is preferred to his because of a prior claim or a hypothec; (2) in favour of the acquirer of property who pays a creditor whose claim is secured by a hypothec on the property; (3) in favour of a person who pays a debt to which he is bound with others or for others and which he has an interest in paying; (4) in favour of an heir who pays with his own funds a debt of the succession for which he was not bound; (5) in any other case provided by law.
### Chunk 1406

1991, c. 64, a. 1656; I. N. 20140501. 1657. Subrogation has effect against the principal debtor and his warrantors, who may set up against the person subrogated the defenses they had against the original creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1657. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 321 of 556 ### Page 322 1658. A creditor who has been only partly paid may exercise his rights with respect to the balance of his claim in preference to the person subrogated from whom he has received only part of his claim.
### Chunk 1407

However, if the creditor has obligated himself to the person subrogated to guarantee payment of the amount for which the subrogation is acquired, the person subrogated has preference. 1991, c. 64, a. 1658; I. N. 20140501. 1659. Except where there is agreement to the contrary, persons who are subrogated to the rights of the same creditor are paid in proportion to their share in the subrogated payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1659; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III NOVATION 1660. Novation is effected where the debtor contracts towards his creditor a new debt which is substituted for the former debt, which is extinguished, or where a new debtor is substituted for the former debtor, who is discharged by the creditor; in such a case, novation may be effected without the consent of the former debtor.
### Chunk 1408

Novation is also effected where, by the effect of a new contract, a new creditor is substituted for the former creditor, towards whom the debtor is discharged. 1991, c. 64, a. 1660; I. N. 20140501. 1661. Novation is not presumed; the intention to effect it must be evident. 1991, c. 64, a. 1661; I. N. 20140501. 1662. Hypothecs attached to the former claim are not transferred to the claim substituted for it, unless they are expressly reserved by the creditor. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1409

64, a. 1662; I. N. 20140501. 1663. Where novation is effected by substitution of a new debtor, the new debtor may not set up against the creditor the defenses which he could have raised against the former debtor, nor the defenses which the former debtor had against the creditor, unless, in the latter case, he may invoke the nullity of the act that bound them. Furthermore, hypothecs attached to the former claim may not be transferred to the property of the new debtor; nor may they be reserved upon the property of the former debtor without his consent.
### Chunk 1410

However, they may be transferred to property acquired from the former debtor by the new debtor, if the new debtor consents thereto. 1991, c. 64, a. 1663; I. N. 20140501. 1664. Where novation is effected between the creditor and one of the solidary debtors, hypothecs attached to the former claim may only be reserved upon the property of the codebtor who contracts the new debt. 1991, c. 64, a. 1664; I. N. 20140501. 1665. Novation effected between the creditor and one of the solidary debtors releases the other codebtors with respect to the creditor; novation effected with respect to the principal debtor releases the sureties.
### Chunk 1411

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 322 of 556 ### Page 323 However, where the creditor has required the accession of the codebtors, in the first case, or of the sureties, in the second case, the creditor’s former claim subsists if the codebtors or the sureties refuse to accede to the new contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1665; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1666. Novation which has been agreed to by one of the solidary creditors may not be set up against the other cocreditors, except for his share in the solidary claim.
### Chunk 1412

1991, c. 64, a. 1666; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION IV DELEGATION 1667. Designation by a debtor of a person who is to pay in his place constitutes a delegation of payment only when the delegate obligates himself personally to the delegatee to make the payment; otherwise, it merely constitutes an indication of payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1667. 1668. Where the delegatee accepts the delegation, he retains his rights against the delegator, unless it is evident that the delegatee intends to discharge him.
### Chunk 1413

1991, c. 64, a. 1668; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 200. 1669. The delegate may not set up against the delegatee the defenses he could have raised against the delegator, even though he did not know of their existence at the time of the delegation. This rule does not apply if, at the time of the delegation, nothing is due to the delegatee, nor does it prejudice the remedy of the delegate against the delegator. 1991, c. 64, a. 1669. 1670. The delegate may set up against the delegatee all such defenses as the delegator could have set up against the delegatee.
### Chunk 1414

The delegate may not set up compensation, however, for what the delegator owes to the delegatee or for what the delegatee owes to the delegator. 1991, c. 64, a. 1670. CHAPTER VIII EXTINCTION OF OBLIGATIONS DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISION 1671. Obligations are extinguished not only by the causes of extinction contemplated in other provisions of this Code, such as payment, the expiry of an extinctive term, novation or prescription, but also by compensation, confusion, release, impossibility of performance or discharge of the debtor.
### Chunk 1415

1991, c. 64, a. 1671. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 323 of 556 ### Page 324 DIVISION II COMPENSATION 1672. Where two persons are reciprocally debtor and creditor of each other, the debts for which they are liable are extinguished by compensation, up to the amount of the lesser debt. Compensation may not be claimed from the State, but the State may claim it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1672. 1673. Compensation is effected by operation of law upon the coexistence of debts that are certain, liquid and exigible and both of whose subject is a sum of money or a certain quantity of fungible property identical in kind.
### Chunk 1416

A party may apply for judicial liquidation of a debt in order to set it up for compensation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1673; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1674. Compensation is effected even though the debts are not payable at the same place, provided allowance is made for the expenses of delivery, if any. 1991, c. 64, a. 1674. 1675. A period of grace granted for payment of one of the debts does not prevent compensation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1675. 1676. Compensation is effected regardless of the cause of the obligation that has given rise to the debt.
### Chunk 1417

Compensation does not take place, however, if the claim results from an act performed with intention to harm or if the subject of the debt is property which is exempt from seizure. 1991, c. 64, a. 1676; I. N. 20151101. 1677. Where several debts subject to compensation are owed by the same debtor, the rules for imputation of payment apply. 1991, c. 64, a. 1677; I. N. 20140501. 1678. One of the solidary debtors may not set up compensation for what the creditor owes to his co debtor, except for the share of that codebtor in the solidary debt.
### Chunk 1418

A debtor, whether solidary or not, may not set up compensation against one of the solidary creditors for what a cocreditor owes him, except for the share of that cocreditor in the solidary claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 1678; I. N. 20140501. 1679. A surety may set up compensation for what the creditor owes to the principal debtor, but the principal debtor may not set up compensation for what the creditor owes to the surety. 1991, c. 64, a. 1679. 1680. A debtor who has acquiesced unconditionally in the assignment or hypothecating of claims by his creditor to a third person may not afterwards set up against the third person any compensation that he could have set up against the original creditor before he acquiesced.
### Chunk 1419

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 324 of 556 ### Page 325 An assignment or hypothec in which a debtor has not acquiesced, but which from a certain time may be set up against him, prevents compensation only for debts of the original creditor which arise after that time. 1991, c. 64, a. 1680; I. N. 20140501. 1681. Compensation may neither be effected nor be renounced to the prejudice of the acquired rights of a third person. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1420

1681. 1682. A debtor who could have set up compensation and has nevertheless paid his debt may not afterwards avail himself, to the prejudice of third persons, of any priority or hypothec attached to his claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 1682; 2002, c. 19, s. 15. DIVISION III CONFUSION 1683. Where the qualities of creditor and debtor are united in the same person, confusion is effected, extinguishing the obligation. Nevertheless, in certain cases where confusion ceases to exist, the effects cease also.
### Chunk 1421

1991, c. 64, a. 1683. 1684. Confusion of the qualities of creditor and debtor in the same person avails the sureties. Confusion of the qualities of surety and creditor or of surety and principal debtor does not extinguish the primary obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1684. 1685. Confusion of the qualities of creditor and solidary codebtor or of debtor and solidary cocreditor extinguishes the obligation only to the extent of the share of that codebtor or cocreditor. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1422

1685. 1686. A hypothec is extinguished by confusion of the qualities of hypothecary creditor and owner of the hypothecated property. However, if the creditor is evicted for a cause which is not attributable to him, the hypothec revives. 1991, c. 64, a. 1686. DIVISION IV RELEASE 1687. Release takes place where the creditor releases his debtor from his obligation. Release is complete, unless it is stipulated to be partial. 1991, c. 64, a. 1687. 1688. Release is either express or tacit.
### Chunk 1423

Release is either onerous or gratuitous, according to the nature of the act from which it derives. 1991, c. 64, a. 1688. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 325 of 556 ### Page 326 1689. A creditor who voluntarily surrenders the original title of an obligation to his debtor is presumed to grant him a release of the debt, unless the circumstances indicate that the debtor has paid the debt. Similarly, a creditor who voluntarily surrenders the original title of an obligation to one of the solidary debtors is presumed to grant a release of the debt in favour of all the debtors.
### Chunk 1424

1991, c. 64, a. 1689. 1690. Express release granted to one of the solidary debtors releases the other codebtors only for the share of the codebtor who has been discharged; if one or several of the other codebtors become insolvent, the shares of the insolvents are apportioned rateably between all the other codebtors, except the codebtor to whom the release was granted, whose share is borne by the creditor. Express release granted by one of the solidary creditors releases the debtor only to the extent of the share of that creditor.
### Chunk 1425

1991, c. 64, a. 1690; I. N. 20140501. 1691. Express renunciation of a priority or a hypothec by a creditor does not give rise to a presumption of release of the secured debt. 1991, c. 64, a. 1691. 1692. Express release granted to one of the sureties releases the other sureties to the extent of the remedy they would have had against the released surety. Nevertheless, no payment received by the creditor from the surety for his release may be imputed to the discharge of the principal debtor or of the other sureties, except, as regards the sureties, where they have a remedy against the released surety and to the extent of that remedy.
### Chunk 1426

1991, c. 64, a. 1692. DIVISION V IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE 1693. Where an obligation can no longer be performed by the debtor, by reason of superior force and before he is in default, the debtor is released from the obligation; he is also released from it, even though he was in default, where the creditor could not, in any case, have benefited from the performance of the obligation by reason of that superior force, unless, in either case, the debtor has expressly assumed the risk of superior force.
### Chunk 1427

The burden of proof of superior force is on the debtor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1693; I. N. 20140501. 1694. A debtor released by impossibility of performance may not exact performance of the correlative obligation of the creditor; if the performance has already been rendered, restitution is owed. Where the debtor has performed part of his obligation, the creditor remains bound to perform his own obligation to the extent of his enrichment. 1991, c. 64, a. 1694.

### Chunk 1428

64, Div. VI; I. N. 20140501. 1695. Where a prior or hypothecary creditor acquires the property on which he has a claim, as a result of a sale by the creditor or a sale under judicial authority, the debtor is released from his debt to the creditor up to the market value of the property as at the time of acquisition, less any claims ranking ahead of the acquirer’s claim. The debtor is also released where, within three years from the sale, the creditor who acquired the property receives, by resale of all or part of the property or by any other dealings with respect to it, value equal to or greater than the amount of his claim, including capital, interest and costs, the amount of the disbursements he has made on the property, with interest, and the amount of the other prior or hypothecary claims ranking ahead of his own.

The creditor is presumed to have acquired the property if it is sold to a person in connivance with or related to the creditor, in particular a spouse, a relative or a person connected by marriage or a civil union up to the second degree, a person living with the creditor, a partner or a legal person of which the creditor is a director or that is controlled by the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1696; 1992, c.

If the creditor refuses to grant the acquittance, the debtor may ask the court to declare that he is released. The judgment attesting the release is equivalent to an acquittance with respect to the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1697; I. N. 20140501. 1698. Release of the principal debtor entails release of his sureties and other warrantors, who may exercise the same rights as the principal debtor, even independently of him.
### Chunk 1431

1991, c. 64, a. 1698. CHAPTER IX RESTITUTION OF PRESTATIONS DIVISION I CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH RESTITUTION TAKES PLACE 1699. Restitution of prestations takes place where a person is bound by law to return to another person the property he has received, either without right or in error, or under a juridical act which is subsequently annulled with retroactive effect or whose obligations become impossible to perform by reason of superior force. The court may, exceptionally, refuse restitution where it would have the effect of according an undue advantage to one party, whether the debtor or the creditor, unless it considers it sufficient, in that case, to modify the scope or modalities of the restitution instead.

Restitution of prestations is made in kind, but, if this is impossible or cannot be done without serious inconvenience, it may be made by equivalence. Equivalence is assessed as at the time when the debtor received what he is liable to restore.
### Chunk 1433

1991, c. 64, a. 1700; I. N. 20140501. 1701. In the case of total loss or alienation of property subject to restitution, the person obligated to make the restitution is bound to return the value of the property, considered when it was received, as at the time of its loss or alienation, or as at the time of the restitution, whichever value is the lowest; but if the person is in bad faith or the cause of the restitution is due to his fault, the restitution is made according to whichever value is the highest.
### Chunk 1434

If the property has perished by superior force, however, the debtor is exempt from making restitution, but he shall then transfer to the creditor, where applicable, the indemnity he has received for the loss of the property or, if he has not already received it, the right to the indemnity. If the debtor is in bad faith or the cause of the restitution is due to his fault, he is not exempt from making restitution unless the property would also have perished if it had been in the hands of the creditor.
### Chunk 1435

1991, c. 64, a. 1701; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 204. 1702. Where the property he returns has suffered partial loss, for example a deterioration or any other depreciation in value, the person who is obligated to make restitution is bound to indemnify the creditor for such loss, unless it results from normal use of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1702; I. N. 20140501. 1703. The right to reimbursement for disbursements made with respect to property subject to restitution is governed by the provisions of the Book on Property, applicable to a possessor in good faith or, in case of bad faith or if the cause of the restitution is due to the fault of the person who is bound to make restitution, by those applicable to possessors in bad faith.
### Chunk 1436

1991, c. 64, a. 1703; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 205. 1704. The fruits and revenues of the property being returned belong to the person who is bound to make restitution, and he bears the costs he has incurred to produce them. He owes no indemnity for enjoyment of the property unless that was the primary object of the prestation or unless the property was subject to rapid depreciation. If the person who is bound to make restitution is in bad faith or if the cause of the restitution is due to his fault, he is bound, after compensating for the costs, to return the fruits and revenues and indemnify the creditor for any enjoyment he has derived from the property.
### Chunk 1437

1991, c. 64, a. 1704; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 206. 1705. Costs of restitution are borne by the parties, in proportion, where applicable, to the value of the prestations mutually restored. Where one party is in bad faith, however, or where the cause of the restitution is due to his fault, the costs are borne by that party alone. 1991, c. 64, a. 1705; 2016, c. 4, s. 207. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 328 of 556 ### Page 329 1706.
### Chunk 1438

Minors and persons of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate are bound to make restitution of prestations only to the extent of the enrichment they retain from them; proof of such enrichment is borne by the person claiming restitution. They may, however, be bound to make full restitution where restitution has become impossible through their intentional or gross fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 1706; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 208; 2020, c. 11, s. 77. DIVISION III EFFECTS OF RESTITUTION ON THIRD PERSONS 1707.
### Chunk 1439

Acts of alienation by onerous title performed by a person who is bound to make restitution, if made in favour of a third person in good faith, may be set up against the person to whom restitution is owed. Acts of alienation by gratuitous title may not be set up, subject to the rules on prescription. Any other acts performed in favour of a third person in good faith may be set up against the person to whom restitution is owed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1707. TITLE TWO NOMINATE CONTRACTS CHAPTER I SALE DIVISION I SALE IN GENERAL § 1.
### Chunk 1440

— General provisions 1708. Sale is a contract by which a person, the seller, transfers ownership of property to another person, the buyer, for a price in money which the latter obligates himself to pay. A dismemberment of the right of ownership, or any other right held by a person, may also be transferred by sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1708; I. N. 20140501. 1709. A person charged with the sale of property of another may not acquire such property, even through an intermediary; the same applies to a person charged with administration of property of another or with supervision of its administration, subject, however, as regards the administrator, to article 1312.
### Chunk 1441

Nor may such a person sell his own property for a price paid out of the property or patrimony which he administers or of which he supervises the administration. In no case may such persons apply for annulment of the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1709; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 329 of 556 ### Page 330 § 2. — Promise 1710. The promise of sale with delivery and actual possession is equivalent to sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1710.
### Chunk 1442

1711. Any amount paid on the occasion of a promise of sale is presumed to be a partial payment on account of the price unless otherwise stipulated in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1711; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 209. 1712. Failure by the promisor, whether seller or buyer, to execute title entitles the beneficiary of the promise to obtain a judgment in lieu thereof. 1991, c. 64, a. 1712; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 210. § 3. — Sale of property of another 1713.
### Chunk 1443

The sale of property by a person other than the owner or other than a person charged with its sale or authorized to sell it may be declared null. The sale may not be declared null, however, if the seller becomes the owner of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1713; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1714. The true owner may apply for the annulment of the sale and revendicate the sold property from the buyer unless the sale was made under judicial authority or unless the buyer can set up acquisitive prescription.
### Chunk 1444

If the property is a movable sold in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise, the owner is bound to reimburse the buyer in good faith for the price he has paid. 1991, c. 64, a. 1714; I. N. 20140501. 1715. The buyer as well may apply for the annulment of the sale. He may not do so, however, where the owner himself is not entitled to revendicate the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1715. § 4. — Obligations of the seller 1716. The seller is bound to deliver the property and to warrant the ownership and quality of the property.
### Chunk 1445

These warranties exist by operation of law, whether or not they are stipulated in the contract of sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1716; I. N. 20140501. I. — Delivery 1717. The obligation to deliver the property is fulfilled when the seller puts the buyer in possession of the property or consents to his taking possession of it and all hindrances are removed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1717. 1718. The seller is bound to deliver the property in the condition it is in at the time of the sale, with all its accessories.
### Chunk 1446

1991, c. 64, a. 1718; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 330 of 556 ### Page 331 1719. The seller is bound to hand over to the buyer the titles of ownership in his possession and, in the case of the sale of an immovable, a copy of the act of acquisition of the immovable, of any previous titles and of any location certificate in his possession. 1991, c. 64, a. 1719; I. N. 20140501. 1720. The seller is bound to deliver the area, volume or quantity specified in the contract, whether the sale was made for a price based on measurements or for a flat price, unless it is obvious that the certain and determinate property was sold without regard to such area, volume or quantity.
### Chunk 1447

1991, c. 64, a. 1720; I. N. 20140501. 1721. A seller having granted a term for payment is not bound to deliver the property if the buyer has become insolvent since the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1721. 1722. Delivery expenses are assumed by the seller and removal expenses, by the buyer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1722. II. — Warranty of ownership 1723. The seller is bound to warrant the buyer that the property is free of all rights except those he has declared at the time of the sale.
### Chunk 1448

The seller is bound to discharge the property of all hypothecs, even declared or registered, unless the buyer has assumed the debt so secured. 1991, c. 64, a. 1723. 1724. The seller warrants the buyer against any encroachment on his part unless he has declared it at the time of the sale. The seller also warrants against any encroachment commenced with his knowledge by a third person before the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1724; I. N. 20140501. 1725. The seller of an immovable warrants the buyer against any violation of public law restrictions affecting the property which are exceptions to the ordinary law of ownership.
### Chunk 1449

The seller is not bound to that warranty where he has given notice of these restrictions to the buyer at the time of the sale, where a prudent and diligent buyer could have discovered them by reason of the nature, location and use of the premises or where such restrictions have been registered at the Land Registry Office. 1991, c. 64, a. 1725; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. III. — Warranty of quality 1726. The seller is bound to warrant the buyer that the property and its accessories are, at the time of the sale, free of latent defects which render it unfit for the use for which it was intended or which so diminish its usefulness that the buyer would not have bought it or paid so high a price if he had been aware of them.
### Chunk 1450

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 331 of 556 ### Page 332 The seller is not bound, however, to warrant against any latent defect known to the buyer or any apparent defect; an apparent defect is a defect that can be perceived by a prudent and diligent buyer without the need to resort to an expert. 1991, c. 64, a. 1726; I. N. 20140501. 1727. If the property perishes by reason of a latent defect that existed at the time of the sale, the loss is borne by the seller, who is bound to restore the price; if the loss results from superior force or is due to the fault of the buyer, the buyer shall deduct from his claim the value of the property in the condition it was in at the time of the loss.
### Chunk 1451

1991, c. 64, a. 1727; I. N. 20140501. 1728. If the seller was aware or could not have been unaware of the latent defect, he is bound not only to restore the price, but also to make reparation for the injury suffered by the buyer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1728; I. N. 20140501. 1729. In a sale by a professional seller, a defect is presumed to have existed at the time of the sale if the property malfunctions or deteriorates prematurely in comparison with identical property or property of the same type; such a presumption is rebutted if the defect is due to improper use of the property by the buyer.
### Chunk 1452

1991, c. 64, a. 1729; I. N. 20140501. 1730. The manufacturer, any person who distributes the property under his name or as his own, and any supplier of the property, in particular the wholesaler and the importer, are also bound to a seller’s warranty. 1991, c. 64, a. 1730; 2016, c. 4, s. 211. 1731. Sale under judicial authority does not give rise to any obligation of warranty of the quality of the sold property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1731. IV. — Conventional warranty 1732.
### Chunk 1453

The parties may, in their contract, add to the obligations of legal warranty, diminish its effects or exclude it altogether but in no case may the seller exempt himself from liability for his personal acts or omissions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1732; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 212. 1733. A seller may not exclude or limit his liability unless he has disclosed the defects of which he was aware or could not have been unaware and which affect the right of ownership or the quality of the property.
### Chunk 1454

An exception may be made to this rule where a buyer buys property at his own risk from a seller who is not a professional seller. 1991, c. 64, a. 1733. § 5. — Obligations of the buyer 1734. The buyer is bound to take delivery of the property sold, and to pay the price thereof at the time and place of delivery. He is also bound to pay any expenses related to the act of sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1734; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 332 of 556 ### Page 333 1735.
### Chunk 1455

The buyer owes interest on the sale price from the time of delivery of the property or the expiry of the period agreed by the parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 1735. § 6. — Special rules regarding the exercise of the rights of the parties I. — Rights of the buyer 1736. The buyer of movable property may, if the seller fails to deliver it, consider the sale resolved if the seller is in default by operation of law or if he fails to perform his obligation within the time allowed in the demand putting him in default.
### Chunk 1456

1991, c. 64, a. 1736; I. N. 20151101. 1737. Where the seller is bound to deliver the area, volume or quantity specified in the contract and is unable to do so, the buyer may obtain a reduction of the price or, if the difference causes him serious injury, resolution of the sale. However, where the area, volume or quantity exceeds that specified in the contract, the buyer is bound to pay for the excess or to restore it to the seller. 1991, c. 64, a. 1737; I. N. 20140501. 1738.
### Chunk 1457

A buyer who discovers a risk of infringement of his right of ownership shall, within a reasonable time after discovering it, give notice to the seller, in writing, of the right or claim of the third person, specifying its nature. The seller may not, however, invoke the tardiness of a notice from the buyer if he was aware of the right or claim or could not have been unaware of it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1738; I. N. 20140501. 1739. A buyer who ascertains that the property is defective shall give notice in writing of the defect to the seller within a reasonable time after discovering it.
### Chunk 1458

Where the defect appears gradually, the time begins to run on the day that the buyer could suspect the seriousness and extent of the defect. The seller may not invoke the tardiness of a notice from the buyer if he was aware of the defect or could not have been unaware of it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1739; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. II. — Rights of the seller 1740. The seller of movable property may, if the buyer fails to pay the sale price and to accept delivery of it, consider the sale resolved if the buyer is in default by operation of law or if he fails to perform his obligations within the time allowed in the demand putting him in default.
### Chunk 1459

The seller may also, where it appears that the buyer will not perform a substantial part of his obligations, stop delivery of the property in transit. 1991, c. 64, a. 1740; I. N. 20151101. 1741. Where the sale of movable property was made without a term, the seller may, within 30 days of delivery, consider the sale resolved and revendicate the property if the buyer, being in default, has failed to pay the price and the property is still entire and in the same condition, not having passed into the hands of a third person who has paid the price thereof or of a hypothecary creditor who has obtained surrender thereof.
### Chunk 1460

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 333 of 556 ### Page 334 Where the buyer is in default for failing to pay the price and the property meets the conditions prescribed for resolution of the sale, the seizure of the property by a third person is no hindrance to the rights of the seller. 1991, c. 64, a. 1741; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1742. The seller of immovable property may not apply for resolution of the sale for failure by the buyer to perform one of his obligations unless the contract specifically stipulates that right.
### Chunk 1461

If the seller meets the conditions for applying for resolution, he is bound to exercise his right within five years after the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1742; I. N. 20140501. 1743. A seller of immovable property wishing to avail himself of a resolutory clause shall make a demand to the buyer and, where applicable, any subsequent acquirer, requiring him to remedy the default within 60 days after the demand is registered in the land register; the rules pertaining to taking in payment set out in the Book on Prior Claims and Hypothecs and the measures to be taken prior to the exercise of that right apply, adapted as required, to the resolution of the sale.
### Chunk 1462

A seller who takes back property by exercising a resolutory clause takes it back free of any charges which the buyer may have placed on it after the seller registered his rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1743; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 7. — Various modalities of sale 1991, c. 64, Sd. 7; I. N. 20140501. I. — Trial sales 1744. The sale of property on trial is presumed to be made under a suspensive condition. Where the trial period is not stipulated, the condition is fulfilled upon the buyer’s failure to inform the seller of his refusal within 30 days after delivery of the property.
### Chunk 1463

1991, c. 64, a. 1744. II. — Instalment sales 1745. An instalment sale is a sale with a term by which the seller reserves ownership of the property until full payment of the sale price. A reservation of ownership with respect to a road vehicle or other movable property determined by regulation, or with respect to any movable property acquired for the service or operation of an enterprise, may be set up against third persons only if it has been published; the reservation may be set up against third persons from the date of the sale provided the reservation of ownership is published within seven days.
### Chunk 1464

As well, the transfer of such a reservation may be set up against third persons only if it has been published. 1991, c. 64, a. 1745; 1998, c. 5, s. 2; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 24, s. 165; Erratum (2024) 156 G. O. 2, 755. 1746. An instalment sale transfers to the buyer the risks of loss of the property, except in the case of a consumer contract or where the parties have stipulated otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 1746. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 334 of 556 ### Page 335 1747.
### Chunk 1465

The balance owing by the buyer becomes due where the property is sold under judicial authority or where the buyer assigns his right in the property to a third person without the consent of the seller. 1991, c. 64, a. 1747; I. N. 20140501. 1748. Where the buyer fails to pay the sale price in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the seller may exact immediate payment of the instalments due or take back the sold property; if the contract contains a clause of forfeiture of benefit of the term, the seller may instead exact payment of the balance of the sale price.
### Chunk 1466

1991, c. 64, a. 1748. 1749. A seller or transferee who, upon the default of the buyer, elects to take back the property sold is governed by the rules regarding the exercise of hypothecary rights set out in the Book on Prior Claims and Hypothecs; however, in the case of a consumer contract, only the rules contained in the Consumer Protection Act (chapter P40. 1) are applicable to the exercise by the seller or transferee of the right of repossession. If the reservation of ownership required publication but was not published, the seller or transferee may take the property back only if it is in the hands of the immediate buyer; the seller or transferee takes the property back in its existing condition and subject to the rights and charges with which the buyer may have encumbered it.
### Chunk 1467

If the reservation of ownership required publication but was published late, the seller or transferee may likewise take the property back only if it is in the hands of the immediate buyer, unless the reservation was published before the sale of the property by that buyer, in which case the seller or transferee may also take the property back if it is in the hands of a subsequent acquirer; in all cases, the seller or transferee takes the property back in its existing condition, but subject only to such rights and charges with which the immediate buyer may have encumbered it at the time of the publication of the reservation of ownership and which had already been published.
### Chunk 1468

1991, c. 64, a. 1749; 1998, c. 5, s. 3; 2016, c. 4, s. 213. III. — Sales with right of redemption 1750. A sale with a right of redemption is a sale under a resolutory condition by which the seller transfers ownership of property to the buyer while reserving the right to redeem it. A right of redemption with respect to a road vehicle or other movable property determined by regulation, or with respect to any movable property acquired for the service or operation of an enterprise, may be set up against third persons only if it has been published; the right of redemption may be set up against third persons from the date of the sale provided the right is published within seven days.
### Chunk 1469

As well, the transfer of such a right of redemption may be set up against third persons only if it has been published. 1991, c. 64, a. 1750; 1998, c. 5, s. 4; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 24, s. 166; Erratum (2024) 156 G. O. 2, 755. 1751. A seller wishing to exercise his right of redemption and take back property shall give notice of his intention to the buyer and, if the right of redemption has been published, to any subsequent acquirer against whom he intends to exercise his right.
### Chunk 1470

If the right of redemption has been published, the notice must also be published; in that case, the notice is of 20 days in the case of movable property and 60 days in the case of an immovable. In the case of a consumer contract, the 20 days’ notice is increased to 30 days. 1991, c. 64, a. 1751; 1998, c. 5, s. 5. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 335 of 556 ### Page 336 1752. Where the seller exercises his right of redemption, he takes back the property free of any charges which the buyer may have encumbered it with, provided the seller’s right, if it required publication, was published in due time and in accordance with the rules regarding the publication of rights.
### Chunk 1471

1991, c. 64, a. 1752; 1998, c. 5, s. 6. 1753. The right of redemption may not be stipulated for a term exceeding five years. If the term exceeds five years, it is reduced to five years. 1991, c. 64, a. 1753. 1754. If the buyer of an undivided share of property subject to a right of redemption acquires the whole property through the effect of a partition, he may oblige the seller, if the seller wishes to exercise his right, to take back the whole property. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1472

1754; I. N. 20140501. 1755. Where a sale is made by several persons jointly by way of a single contract or where the seller has left several heirs, the buyer may object to the taking back of a part of the property and require the coseller or coheir to take back the whole property. In other respects, the rules pertaining to joint or divisible obligations, adapted as required, apply to the exercise of the right of redemption existing for the benefit of several sellers, against several buyers, or between their heirs.
### Chunk 1473

1991, c. 64, a. 1755; I. N. 20140501. 1756. Where the object of the right of redemption is to secure a loan, the seller is deemed to be a borrower and the acquirer is deemed to be a hypothecary creditor. The seller does not, however, lose the right to exercise his right of redemption unless the acquirer follows the rules for the exercise of hypothecary rights set out in the Book on Prior Claims and Hypothecs. 1991, c. 64, a. 1756; I. N. 20140501. IV. — Auction sales 1757.
### Chunk 1474

An auction sale is a sale by which property is offered for sale to several persons through the intermediary of a third person, the auctioneer, and declared sold to the last and highest bidder. 1991, c. 64, a. 1757. 1758. An auction sale under judicial authority by the bailiff is conducted in accordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01) and this subheading and, so far as they are consistent, the particulars specified in the notice of sale published by the bailiff.
### Chunk 1475

1991, c. 64, a. 1758; 2014, c. 1, s. 793. 1759. The seller may fix a reserve price or any other conditions of sale. The conditions of sale may not be set up against the successful bidder unless the auctioneer communicates them to the persons present before receiving bids. 1991, c. 64, a. 1759. 1760. The seller may refuse to disclose his identity at the auction but, if his identity is not disclosed to the successful bidder, the auctioneer becomes personally bound by all the obligations of the seller.

1991, c. 64, a. 1760. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 336 of 556 ### Page 337 1761. At no time may a bidder withdraw his bid. 1991, c. 64, a. 1761. 1762. An auction sale is perfected when the auctioneer declares the property sold to the last bidder. Entry of the name and bid of the successful bidder in the auctioneer’s register makes proof of the sale; failing such entry, proof by testimony is admissible. 1991, c. 64, a. 1762; I.
### Chunk 1477

N. 20140501. 1763. The seller of an immovable and the successful bidder shall execute the act of sale within 10 days after either party so requests. 1991, c. 64, a. 1763; I. N. 20140501. 1764. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 1764; 2002, c. 19, s. 8. 1765. If the buyer fails to pay the price in accordance with the conditions of the sale, the auctioneer may, in addition to the ordinary remedies of a seller, resell the property for false bidding, according to usage and after sufficient notice.
### Chunk 1478

A false bidder may not bid again at the resale. He is bound to pay the difference between the price at which the property was sold to him and the resale price, if lesser, but is not entitled to claim any excess amount. He is also, in the case of a forced sale, liable to the seller, the person from whom the property was seized and the creditors having obtained the judgment, for all interest, costs and damages arising from his default. 1991, c. 64, a. 1765; I. N. 20140501. 1766. A successful bidder whose right of ownership of property acquired at an auction sale is infringed as a result of seizure of the property by a creditor of the seller may recover the price paid, with interest and costs, from the seller.
### Chunk 1479

He may also recover the price, with interest, from the creditors of the seller to whom it has been remitted, but they may set up the benefit of discussion against him. He may claim from the seizing creditor damages resulting from any irregularity in the seizure or sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1766; I. N. 20140501; I.

A right is litigious when it is uncertain, contested or contestable by the debtor, whether an action is pending or there is reason to presume that it will become necessary. 1991, c. 64, a. 1782. 1783. No judge, advocate, notary or officer of justice may acquire litigious rights, on pain of absolute nullity of the sale.
### Chunk 1484

1991, c. 64, a. 1783. 1784. Where litigious rights are sold, the person from whom they are claimed is fully discharged by paying to the buyer the sale price, the costs and the interest on the price computed from the day payment was made. This right of withdrawal may not be exercised where the sale is made to a creditor in payment of what is due to him, to a coheir or coowner of the rights sold or to the possessor of the property subject to the right. Nor may it be exercised where a court has rendered a judgment affirming the rights sold or where the rights have been established and the case is ready for judgment.
### Chunk 1485

1991, c. 64, a. 1784; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II SPECIAL RULES REGARDING SALE OF RESIDENTIAL IMMOVABLES 1785. The sale of an existing or planned residential immovable by the builder or a developer to a natural person who acquires it to occupy it shall be preceded by a preliminary contract by which a person promises to buy the immovable, whether or not the sale includes the transfer to him of the seller’s rights over the land. The preliminary contract shall include a stipulation that the promisor may withdraw his promise within 10 days after signing it.
### Chunk 1486

Where a memorandum must be given, the preliminary contract shall also include a stipulation that the promisor may, if the seller fails to give the memorandum to the promisor at the time the preliminary contract is signed, withdraw his promise until he receives the memorandum or within 10 days after receiving it. 1991, c. 64, a. 1785; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 61. 1786. In addition to the name and address of the seller and of the promisor, the work to be performed, the sale price, the date of delivery and the real rights charging the immovable, the preliminary contract shall contain any useful information pertaining to the characteristics of the immovable and, where the sale price is subject to review, the terms and conditions of review.
### Chunk 1487

A government regulation may determine other information that must be included in the preliminary contract. Where the preliminary contract provides for an indemnity in case of exercise of the right of withdrawal, the indemnity may not exceed 0. 5% of the agreed sale price. 1991, c. 64, a. 1786; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 62. 1787. Where a fraction of an immovable under divided coownership or an undivided share of a residential immovable is sold, the seller shall give the promisor a memorandum at the time the preliminary contract is signed; he shall also furnish the memorandum where a residence forming part of a residential development having common facilities is sold.
### Chunk 1488

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 339 of 556 ### Page 340 A memorandum shall also be given where the same fraction of an immovable under coownership is sold to several persons who thereby acquire a periodic and successive right of enjoyment in the fraction. 1991, c. 64, a. 1787; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 63. 1788. The memorandum complements the preliminary contract. In addition to the information prescribed by government regulation, it contains the names of the architects, engineers, builders and developers, a plan of the overall property development project and, where applicable, the general development plan of the project and a summary of the descriptive specifications.
### Chunk 1489

It also contains the budget forecast, indicates the common facilities and contains information on the management of the immovable and, where applicable, on the rights of emphyteusis or superficies to which the immovable is subject. It also indicates, where applicable, that the immovable is covered by a guarantee plan, and the manner in which the promisor can consult that plan. A copy or summary of the declaration of coownership or indivision agreement and of the bylaws of the immovable shall be appended to the memorandum even if they are draft documents.
### Chunk 1490

1991, c. 64, a. 1788; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 64. 1789. Where a fraction of an immovable under divided coownership is sold, the memorandum contains a statement of the leases granted by the developer or the builder on the private or common portions of the immovable and indicates the maximum number of fractions intended for lease by the developer or builder. 1991, c. 64, a. 1789; I. N. 20140501. 1790. Where the developer or builder grants a lease in excess of the maximum number indicated in the memorandum, the syndicate of coowners, after notifying the lessor and the lessee, may demand the resiliation of the lease.
### Chunk 1491

If there are several leases in excess of the maximum number, the most recent leases shall be resiliated first. 1991, c. 64, a. 1790; I. N. 20140501. 1791. The budget forecast shall be prepared on the basis of one year of full occupancy of the immovable; in the case of an immovable under divided coownership, it is prepared for a period beginning on the date of registration of the declaration of coownership. A budget includes, in particular, a statement of debts and claims, revenues and expenditures and common expenses.
### Chunk 1492

It also indicates, for each fraction, the likely amount of property taxes, the rate of such taxes and the annual amount of contributions to the common expenses. The part of that amount intended for the contingency fund must correspond either to 0. 5% of the reconstruction cost of the immovable or to the recommendations made in a contingency fund study. Where the amounts provided in the budget forecast prepared by the developer for the fiscal years during which the developer controls the syndicate are more than 10% below the amounts the syndicate had to incur for the first full fiscal year after the developer lost control of the syndicate, the developer shall reimburse to the syndicate the difference between the amounts provided in the forecast and the amounts actually incurred.
### Chunk 1493

However, the developer is not bound to do so to the extent that the difference is attributable to decisions made by the syndicate on or after the day a new board of directors was appointed following the loss of such control. 1991, c. 64, a. 1791; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 65. Concerning the annual amount of contributions to the common expenses included in the budget forecast, see 2019, c. 28, s. 165(8). 1791. 1. Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, any deposit paid to a builder or a developer toward the purchase of a fraction of an immovable under divided coownership must be fully protected by one or more of the following means: a guarantee plan, insurance, a suretyship or a deposit in a trust account of a member of a professional order according to the terms and conditions determined by government regulation.

The deposit is returned to the person who paid it if the fraction of the immovable under coownership is not delivered on the date agreed upon in accordance with the terms and conditions determined by government regulation. 2019, c. 28, s. 66; 2021, c.
### Chunk 1495

7, s. 1. Concerning the deposit in a trust account, see 2019, c. 28, s. 165(9). 1792. The sale of a fraction of an immovable under coownership may be resolved without formality where the declaration of coownership is not registered within 30 days after the date on which it may be registered pursuant to the Book on Publication of Rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 1792; I. N. 20140501. 1793. Where the sale of a residential immovable is not preceded by the preliminary contract or the memorandum, the buyer may, if he suffers serious injury therefrom, apply for the annulment of the sale and for damages.
### Chunk 1496

If the buyer prefers that the contract be maintained, he may apply for a reduction of his obligation equivalent to the damages he would be justified to claim. The action must be brought within 90 days after the sale, that is, within 90 days following the special meeting provided for in article 1104 of this Code. The same applies where the preliminary contract or the memorandum contains errors or deficiencies. 1991, c. 64, a. 1793; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 67. 1794. The sale by a contractor of land belonging to him, along with an existing or planned residential immovable, is subject to the rules pertaining to warranties in contracts of enterprise or for services, adapted as required.
### Chunk 1497

Those rules also apply to sales by a property developer. 1991, c. 64, a. 1794; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III VARIOUS CONTRACTS SIMILAR TO SALE § 1. — Exchange 1795. Exchange is a contract by which the parties transfer ownership of property other than money to each other. 1991, c. 64, a. 1795. 1796. Where one of the parties proves, even after having received the property transferred to him in exchange, that the other party was not the owner of the property, he may not be compelled to deliver the property he had promised in exchange, but only to return the property he has received.

Giving in payment is a contract by which a debtor transfers ownership of property to his creditor, who agrees to take it in place and payment of a sum of money or some other property due to him.
### Chunk 1499

1991, c. 64, a. 1799; I. N. 20140501. 1800. Giving in payment is subject to the rules pertaining to contracts of sale and the person who so transfers property is bound to the same warranties as a seller. Giving in payment is perfected only by delivery of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1800. 1801. Any clause by which a creditor, with a view to securing the performance of the obligation of his debtor, reserves the right to become the irrevocable owner of the property or to dispose of it is deemed not written.
### Chunk 1500

1991, c. 64, a. 1801. § 3. — Alienation for rent 1802. Alienation for rent is a contract by which the lessor transfers the ownership of an immovable to a lessee in return for a ground rent which the latter obligates himself to pay. The rent is payable in money or in kind, at the end of each year, from the date of constitution of the rent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1802. 1803. The lessee may free himself at any time from the annual payments of rent by offering to reimburse the capital value of the rent and renouncing the recovery of the payments made, but he may not substitute an insurer to make the payments in his place.
### Chunk 1501

1991, c. 64, a. 1803. 1804. The lessee is personally liable to the lessor for the rent. He is not discharged from his obligation by his abandonment of the immovable or its destruction by superior force. 1991, c. 64, a. 1804; I. N. 20140501. 1805.

### Chunk 1502

Gift is a contract by which a person, the donor, transfers ownership of the property by gratuitous title to another person, the donee; a dismemberment of the right of ownership, or any other right held by a person, may also be transferred by gift. Gifts may be inter vivos or mortis causa. 1991, c. 64, a. 1806; I. N. 20140501. 1807. A gift inter vivos is one whereby there is actual divesting of the donor, in the sense that the donor actually becomes the debtor of the donee. The divesting of the donor is not prevented from being actual by the fact that the transfer or delivery of the property is subject to a term or that the transfer is with respect to certain and determinate property which the donor undertakes to acquire or property determinate only as to kind which the donor undertakes to deliver.
### Chunk 1503

1991, c. 64, a. 1807; I. N. 20140501. 1808. A gift mortis causa is one whereby the divesting of the donor remains conditional upon his death and takes place only at that time. 1991, c. 64, a. 1808; I. N. 20140501. 1809. An act by which a person renounces a right that he has not yet acquired or unconditionally renounces a succession or legacy does not constitute a gift. 1991, c. 64, a. 1809. 1810. A remunerative gift or a gift with a charge constitutes a gift only for the value in excess of that of the remuneration or charge.
### Chunk 1504

1991, c. 64, a. 1810. 1811. Indirect gifts and disguised gifts are governed by the provisions of this chapter, except as to their form. 1991, c. 64, a. 1811; I. N. 20140501. 1812. The promise of a gift does not constitute a gift but only confers on the beneficiary of the promise the right to claim from the promisor, on the latter’s failure to fulfil his promise, damages equivalent to the benefits which the beneficiary has granted and the expenses he has incurred in consideration of the promise.

A minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate, even represented by his tutor or mandatary, may make gifts only of property of little value or customary presents, subject to the stipulations in the protection mandate and the rules pertaining to marriage or civil union contracts.
### Chunk 1506

1991, c. 64, a. 1813; 2002, c. 6, s. 50; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 78. 1814. The father and mother, the parents or the tutor may accept gifts made to a minor or, provided he is born alive and viable, to a child conceived but yet unborn. Only the tutor or mandatary may accept gifts made to a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate. Nevertheless, a minor or a person of full age who has a tutor or mandatary may, acting alone, accept gifts of property of little value or customary presents.
### Chunk 1507

1991, c. 64, a. 1814; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2022, c. 22, s. 118; 2020, c. 11, s. 79. 1815. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 1815; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 80. § 2. — Certain rules governing the validity of gifts 1816. The gift of property by a person who does not own it or who is not charged with giving it or authorized to give it is null, unless the donor has expressly undertaken to acquire the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1816. 1817. A gift made to the owner, a director or an employee of a health or social services establishment who is neither the spouse nor a close relative of the donor is null if it was made while the donor was receiving care or services at the establishment.
### Chunk 1508

A gift made to a member of a foster family while the donor was residing with that family is also null. 1991, c. 64, a. 1817. 1818. Gifts inter vivos are valid only as to present property. The gift of future property is deemed to be mortis causa, but the gift of both present and future property is deemed to be mortis causa only with respect to the future property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1818. 1819. A gift mortis causa is null unless it is made by marriage or civil union contract or unless it may be upheld as a legacy.
### Chunk 1509

1991, c. 64, a. 1819; 2002, c. 6, s. 50. 1820. A gift made during the deemed mortal illness of the donor is null as having been made mortis causa, whether or not death follows, unless circumstances tend to render it valid. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 344 of 556 ### Page 345 Nevertheless, if the donor recovers and leaves the donee in peaceable possession for three years, the nullity is covered. 1991, c. 64, a. 1820; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1510

1821. A gift inter vivos which imposes on the donee the obligation to pay debts or charges other than those existing at the time of the gift is null, unless the nature and amount of those other debts or charges are specified in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1821. 1822. A gift inter vivos stipulated to be revocable at the sole discretion of the donor is null, even if it is made by marriage or civil union contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1822; 2002, c. 6, s. 50. 1823. A gift inter vivos may only be made by particular title; otherwise, it is absolutely null.

DIVISION III RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES § 1. — General provisions 1825.
### Chunk 1512

The donor delivers the property by putting the donee in possession of it or allowing him to take possession of it, all hindrances being removed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1825. 1826. The donor is bound to transfer only the rights he holds in the property given. 1991, c. 64, a. 1826. 1827. The donee may recover from the donor a payment he has made to free the property of a right vested in a third person or to execute a charge, only to the extent the payment exceeds the benefit he derives from the gift.
### Chunk 1513

The evicted donee may, however, recover from the donor the expenses paid in connection with the gift in excess of the benefit he derives from it if the eviction, whether total or partial, results from a defect in the transferred right which the donor was aware of but failed to disclose at the time of the gift. 1991, c. 64, a. 1827; I. N. 20140501. 1828. The donor is not liable for latent defects in the property given. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 345 of 556 ### Page 346 However, he is bound to make reparation for injury caused to the donee as a result of a defect which impairs his physical integrity, if he was aware of the defect but failed to disclose it at the time of the gift.
### Chunk 1514

1991, c. 64, a. 1828; I. N. 20140501. 1829. The donor pays the expenses for the contract and the donee pays those for the removal of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 1829; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Debts of the donor 1830. Unless otherwise provided in the contract or by law, the donee is only liable for debts of the donor connected with a universality of assets and liabilities he receives. 1991, c. 64, a. 1830. § 3. — Charges stipulated in favour of third persons 1831.
### Chunk 1515

A gift may be made with a charge or a stipulation in favour of a third person. 1991, c. 64, a. 1831. 1832. A charge stipulated in favour of several persons with no determination of their respective shares entails, upon the death of one of them, the accretion of his share in favour of the surviving cobeneficiaries. However, where the respective shares of the beneficiaries are determined, the death of one of them does not entail accretion. 1991, c. 64, a. 1832; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1516

1833. The donee is personally liable for charges on the property given. 1991, c. 64, a. 1833. 1834. A charge which, owing to circumstances unforeseeable at the time of the acceptance of the gift, becomes impossible or too burdensome for the donee may be varied or revoked by the court, taking account of the value of the gift, the intention of the donor and the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1834. 1835. The revocation or lapse of a charge stipulated in favour of a third person benefits the donee, unless another beneficiary is designated.
### Chunk 1517

1991, c. 64, a. 1835. DIVISION IV REVOCATION OF GIFTS ON ACCOUNT OF INGRATITUDE 1836. Gifts inter vivos may be revoked on account of ingratitude. Ingratitude is a ground of revocation where the donee has behaved in a seriously reprehensible manner towards the donor, having regard to the nature of the gift, the faculties of the parties and the circumstances. 1991, c. 64, a. 1836. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 346 of 556 ### Page 347 1837.
### Chunk 1518

The action in revocation may be brought only during the lifetime of the donee and within one year after the ingratitude became a ground or the day the donor became aware of it. The death of the donor within the time for bringing an action does not extinguish the right of action, but the heirs of the donor may act only within one year after his death. 1991, c. 64, a. 1837. 1838. The revocation of a gift obliges the donee to restore to the donor what he has received under the contract, in accordance with the rules of this Book pertaining to the restitution of prestations.
### Chunk 1519

The revocation extinguishes, for the future, the charges stipulated in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1838. DIVISION V GIFTS MADE BY MARRIAGE OR CIVIL UNION CONTRACT 2002, c. 6, s. 50. 1839. Gifts made by marriage or civil union contract may be inter vivos or mortis causa. They are valid only if the contract takes effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1839; 2002, c. 6, s. 50. 1840. Any person may make a gift inter vivos by marriage or civil union contract but only the future spouses, the spouses, their respective children and their common children born or yet unborn, if they are born alive and viable, may be donees.
### Chunk 1520

The only persons between whom gifts mortis causa may be made are those entitled to be beneficiaries of gifts inter vivos made by marriage or civil union contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 1840; 2002, c. 6, s. 51. 1841. Gifts mortis causa, even those made by particular title, are revocable. However, if a donor has stipulated that a gift is irrevocable, he may not dispose of the property gratuitously by an act inter vivos or by will without the consent of the donee and of all other interested persons, unless the gift consists of property of little value or customary presents.
### Chunk 1521

The donor continues nonetheless to hold his rights in the property given and he remains free to alienate it by onerous title. 1991, c. 64, a. 1841; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER III LEASING 1842. Leasing is a contract by which a person, the lessor, puts movable property at the disposal of another person, the lessee, for a fixed term and for consideration.

N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 216. 1843. Property that is the subject of a leasing, even if attached or joined to an immovable, retains its movable nature for as long as the contract lasts, provided it does not lose its individuality. 1991, c. 64, a. 1843. 1844. The lessor shall disclose the contract of leasing in the act of purchase.
### Chunk 1523

1991, c. 64, a. 1844; I. N. 20140501. 1845. The seller of the property is directly bound towards the lessee by the legal and conventional warranties inherent in the contract of sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 1845. 1846. The lessee assumes all risks of loss of the property, even by superior force, from the time he takes possession of it. He likewise assumes all maintenance and repair expenses. 1991, c. 64, a. 1846. 1847. The rights of ownership of the lessor may be set up against third persons only if they have been published; the rights may be set up against third persons from the date of the leasing contract provided the rights are published within seven days.
### Chunk 1524

As well, the transfer of the lessor’s rights of ownership may be set up against third persons only if it has been published. 1991, c. 64, a. 1847; 1998, c. 5, s. 7; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 24, s. 167; Erratum (2024) 156 G. O. 2, 755. 1848. Once the lessor is in default, the lessee may consider the contract of leasing resolved if the property is not delivered to the lessee within a reasonable time after the formation of the contract or within the time fixed in the demand for delivery.
### Chunk 1525

1991, c. 64, a. 1848; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1849. Where the contract of leasing is resolved and the lessee has derived a benefit from the contract, the lessor, when returning the prestations he has received from the lessee, may deduct a reasonable sum to take account of such benefit. 1991, c. 64, a. 1849. 1850. Upon termination of the contract of leasing, the lessee is bound to return the property to the lessor unless, where applicable, he has availed himself of the option to acquire it given to him by the contract.

1991, c. 64, a. 1850. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 348 of 556 ### Page 349 CHAPTER IV LEASE DIVISION I NATURE OF LEASE 1851. Lease is a contract by which a person, the lessor, undertakes to provide another person, the lessee, in return for a rent, with the enjoyment of movable or immovable property for a certain time. The term of a lease is fixed or indeterminate. 1991, c. 64, a. 1851; I. N. 20140501. 1852. The rights resulting from the lease may be published.
### Chunk 1527

Publication is required, however, in the case of rights resulting from a lease, with a term of more than one year, of a road vehicle or other movable property determined by regulation, or of any movable property required for the service or operation of an enterprise, subject, in the latter case, to the exclusions provided by regulation; the rights may be set up against third persons from the date of the lease provided they are published within seven days. A lease with a term of one year or less is deemed to have a term of more than one year if, by the operation of a renewal clause or other covenant to the same effect, the term of the lease may be increased to more than one year.
### Chunk 1528

The transfer of rights under a lease requires or is open to publication, according to whether the rights themselves require or are open to publication. 1991, c. 64, a. 1852; 1998, c. 5, s. 8; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 24, s. 168; Erratum (2024) 156 G. O. 2, 755. 1853. The lease of movable property is not presumed; a person using the property by sufferance of the owner is presumed to have borrowed it by virtue of a loan for use. The lease of immovable property is presumed where a person occupies the premises by sufferance of the owner.
### Chunk 1529

The term of the lease is indeterminate; the lease takes effect upon occupancy and entails the obligation to pay a rent corresponding to the rental value. 1991, c. 64, a. 1853. DIVISION II RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM LEASE § 1. — General provisions 1854. The lessor is bound to deliver the leased property to the lessee in a good state of repair in all respects and to provide him with peaceable enjoyment of the property throughout the term of the lease. He is also bound to warrant the lessee that the property may be used for the purpose for which it was leased and to maintain the property for that purpose throughout the term of the lease.
### Chunk 1530

1991, c. 64, a. 1854. 1855. The lessee is bound to pay the agreed rent and to use the property with prudence and diligence during the term of the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1855. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 349 of 556 ### Page 350 1856. Neither the lessor nor the lessee may change the form or destination of the leased property during the term of the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1856. 1857. The lessor has the right to ascertain the condition of the leased property, to carry out work thereon and, in the case of an immovable, to have it visited by a prospective lessee or acquirer; he is, however, bound to exercise his right in a reasonable manner.
### Chunk 1531

1991, c. 64, a. 1857; I. N. 20140501. 1858. The lessor is bound to warrant the lessee against legal disturbances to enjoyment of the leased property. Before pursuing his remedies, the lessee shall notify the lessor of the disturbance. 1991, c. 64, a. 1858; I. N. 20140501. 1859. The lessor is not bound to make reparation for injury resulting from disturbance to enjoyment of the property caused by the act or omission of a third person; he may be so bound where the third person is also a lessee of that property or is a person the lessee allows to use or to have access to the property.
### Chunk 1532

However, if the enjoyment of the property is diminished by the disturbance, the lessee retains his other remedies against the lessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1859; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 217. 1860. A lessee is bound to act in such a way as not to disturb the normal enjoyment of the other lessees. He is bound, towards the lessor and the other lessees, to make reparation for injury that results from a violation of that obligation, whether the violation is due to his own act or omission or to the act or omission of persons he allows to use or to have access to the property.
### Chunk 1533

In case of violation of this obligation, the lessor may apply for resiliation of the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1860; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 218. 1861. A lessee who is disturbed by another lessee or by persons whom another lessee allows to use or to have access to the property may obtain, according to the circumstances, a reduction of rent or the resiliation of the lease, if he notified the common lessor of the disturbance and if the disturbance persists. He may also recover damages from the common lessor unless the lessor proves that he acted with prudence and diligence; the lessor has a recourse against the lessee at fault to be indemnified for the injury suffered by him.
### Chunk 1534

1991, c. 64, a. 1861; I. N. 20140501. 1862. The lessee is bound to make reparation for injury suffered by the lessor by reason of any loss sustained by the leased property, unless he proves that the loss is not due to his fault or that of persons he allows to use or to have access to the property. Where the leased property is an immovable, the lessee is not bound for injury resulting from a fire unless it is proved that the fire was due to his fault or that of persons he allowed to have access to the immovable.
### Chunk 1535

1991, c. 64, a. 1862; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 350 of 556 ### Page 351 1863. The nonperformance of an obligation by one of the parties entitles the other party to apply for, in addition to damages, specific performance of the obligation in cases which admit of it. He may apply for the resiliation of the lease where the nonperformance causes serious injury to him or, in the case of the lease of an immovable, to the other occupants.
### Chunk 1536

The nonperformance also entitles the lessee to apply for a reduction of rent; where the court grants it, the lessor, upon remedying his default, is nonetheless entitled to the reestablishment of the rent for the future. 1991, c. 64, a. 1863; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 2. — Repairs 1864. The lessor is bound, during the term of the lease, to make all necessary repairs to the leased property other than minor maintenance repairs, which are assumed by the lessee unless they result from the age of the property or superior force.
### Chunk 1537

1991, c. 64, a. 1864; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 219. 1865. The lessee shall allow urgent and necessary repairs to be made to ensure the preservation or enjoyment of the leased property. A lessor who makes such repairs may require the lessee to vacate or be dispossessed of the property temporarily but, if the repairs are not urgent, he shall first obtain the authorization of the court, which also fixes the conditions required to protect the rights of the lessee. The lessee retains, according to the circumstances, the right to obtain a reduction of rent, to apply for the resiliation of the lease or, if he vacates or is dispossessed of the property temporarily, to demand an indemnity.
### Chunk 1538

1991, c. 64, a. 1865; I. N. 20140501. 1866. A lessee who becomes aware of a serious defect or deterioration of the leased property is bound to inform the lessor within a reasonable time. 1991, c. 64, a. 1866. 1867. Where a lessor fails to make the repairs or improvements he is bound to make under the lease or by law, the lessee may apply to the court for authorization to carry them out himself. If the court grants authorization to make the repairs or improvements, it determines their amount and fixes the conditions to be complied with in carrying them out.
### Chunk 1539

The lessee may then withhold from his rent the amount of the expenses incurred to carry out the authorized work, up to the amount fixed by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 1867; I. N. 20140501. 1868. After the lessee has attempted to inform the lessor, or has informed him and the lessor fails to act in due time, the lessee may undertake repairs or incur expenses, even without the authorization of the court, provided they are urgent and necessary to ensure the preservation or enjoyment of the leased property.
### Chunk 1540

The lessor may intervene at any time, however, to pursue the work. The lessee is entitled to reimbursement of the reasonable expenses he incurred for that purpose; he may, if necessary, withhold the amount of such expenses from his rent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1868; I. N. 20140501. 1869. The lessee is bound to render an account to the lessor of the repairs or improvements made to the property and the expenses incurred and to hand over to him the vouchers for such expenses and, in the case of movable property, the replaced parts.
### Chunk 1541

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 351 of 556 ### Page 352 The lessor is bound to reimburse the lessee for any amount in excess of the rent withheld, but not in excess of the amount the lessee was authorized to disburse, where that is the case. 1991, c. 64, a. 1869; I. N. 20140501. § 3. — Sublease of property and assignment of lease 1870. A lessee may sublease all or part of the leased property or assign the lease. In either case, he is bound to give the lessor notice of his intention and the name and address of the intended sublessee or assignee and to obtain the lessor’s consent to the sublease or assignment.
### Chunk 1542

1991, c. 64, a. 1870; I. N. 20140501. 1871. The lessor may not refuse to consent to the sublease of the property or the assignment of the lease without a serious reason. If he refuses, he is bound to inform the lessee of his reasons for refusing within 15 days after receiving the notice; otherwise, he is deemed to have consented. 1991, c. 64, a. 1871; I. N. 20140501. 1872. A lessor who consents to the sublease of the property or the assignment of the lease may not exact any payment other than the reimbursement of any reasonable expenses resulting from the sublease or assignment.
### Chunk 1543

1991, c. 64, a. 1872. 1873. The assignment of a lease discharges the former lessee of his obligations, unless, where the lease is not a lease of a dwelling, the parties agree otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 1873; I. N. 20151101. 1874. Where the lessor brings an action against the lessee, the sublessee is not bound towards the lessor for any amount except the rent for the sublease which he owes to the lessee; the sublessee may not set up advance payments. Payments made by the sublessee either under a stipulation that is included in his lease and has been made known to the lessor, or in accordance with the usage of the place, are not considered to be advance payments.
### Chunk 1544

1991, c. 64, a. 1874; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1875. Where the nonperformance of an obligation by a sublessee causes serious injury to the lessor or the other lessees or occupants, the lessor may apply for the resiliation of the sublease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1875; I. N. 20140501. 1876. Where a lessor fails to perform his obligations, the sublessee may exercise the rights and remedies of the lessee to have them performed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1876. DIVISION III TERMINATION OF THE LEASE 1877.
### Chunk 1545

A lease with a fixed term terminates by operation of law upon expiry of the term. A lease with an indeterminate term terminates upon resiliation by one of the parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 1877; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 352 of 556 ### Page 353 1878. A lease with a fixed term may be renewed. The renewal must be express, unless the lease is of an immovable, in which case the renewal may be tacit. 1991, c. 64, a. 1878; I.
### Chunk 1546

N. 20140501. 1879. A lease is renewed tacitly where the lessee continues to occupy the premises for more than 10 days after the expiry of the lease without opposition from the lessor. In that case, the lease is renewed for one year or for the term of the initial lease, if that was less than one year, on the same conditions. The renewed lease is also subject to renewal. 1991, c. 64, a. 1879. 1880. The term of a lease may not exceed 100 years. If it exceeds 100 years, it is reduced to that term.
### Chunk 1547

1991, c. 64, a. 1880. 1881. Security given by a third person to secure the performance of the obligations of the lessee does not extend to a renewed lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1881. 1882. A party who intends to resiliate a lease with an indeterminate term shall give the other party notice to that effect. The time for giving the notice is the same as the rent payment period, or three months if the rent payment period exceeds three months. However, if the leased property is a movable, the time for giving the notice is 10 days, regardless of the rent payment period.
### Chunk 1548

1991, c. 64, a. 1882; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1883.

Where the lease is for an indeterminate term, the lessee is bound to allow such activities from the date of the notice of resiliation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1885. 1886. Voluntary or forced alienation of leased property or extinction of the lessor’s title for any other reason does not terminate the lease by operation of law.

N. 20140501. 1899. A lessor may not refuse to enter into a lease with a person or to maintain the person in his or her rights, or impose more onerous conditions on the person for the sole reason that the person is pregnant or has one or several children, unless the refusal is warranted by the size of the dwelling; nor can he so act for the sole reason that the person has exercised his or her rights under this chapter or the Act respecting the Administrative Housing Tribunal (chapter T15.
### Chunk 1564

01). Punitive damages may be awarded in cases where this provision is violated. 1991, c. 64, a. 1899; 2019, c. 28, s. 158. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 356 of 556 ### Page 357 1900. A clause which limits the liability of the lessor or exempts him from liability or renders the lessee liable for injury caused without his fault is without effect. A clause to modify the rights of a lessee by reason of an increase in the number of occupants, unless the size of the dwelling warrants it, or to limit the right of a lessee to purchase property or obtain services from such persons as he chooses, and on such terms and conditions as he sees fit, is also without effect.
### Chunk 1565

1991, c. 64, a. 1900; I. N. 20140501. 1901. A clause stipulating a penalty of an amount exceeding the value of the injury actually suffered by the lessor, or imposing an obligation on the lessee which is unreasonable in the circumstances, is an abusive clause. Such a clause is null or any obligation arising from it may be reduced. 1991, c. 64, a. 1901; I. N. 20140501. 1902. Neither the lessor nor any other person may harass a lessee in such a manner as to limit his right to peaceable enjoyment of the premises or to induce him to leave the dwelling.
### Chunk 1566

A lessee who suffers harassment may demand that the lessor or any other person who has harassed him be condemned to pay punitive damages. 1991, c. 64, a. 1902. § 3. — Rent 1903. The rent agreed upon shall be indicated in the lease. It is payable in equal instalments, except for the last, which may be less; it is payable on the first day of each payment period, unless otherwise agreed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1903; I. N. 20140501. 1904. The lessor may not exact any instalment in excess of one month’s rent; he may not exact payment of rent in advance for more than the first payment period or, if that period exceeds one month, payment of more than one month’s rent.
### Chunk 1567

Nor may he exact any amount of money other than the rent, in the form of a deposit or otherwise, or demand that payment be made by postdated cheque or any other postdated instrument. 1991, c. 64, a. 1904. 1905. A clause in a lease stipulating that the full amount of the rent will be payable in the event of the failure by the lessee to pay an instalment is without effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1905; I. N. 20140501. 1906. A clause in a lease with a fixed term of 12 months or less providing for an adjustment of the rent during the term of the lease is without effect.
### Chunk 1568

A clause in a lease with a term of more than 12 months providing for an adjustment of the rent during the first 12 months of the lease or more than once during each 12 month period is also without effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1906. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 357 of 556 ### Page 358 1907.

The parties are then subject to the provisions of articles 1867 and 1869.
### Chunk 1569

The lessee may also deposit his rent in the office of the court, if he gives the lessor prior 10 days’ notice indicating the grounds for depositing it and if the court, considering that the grounds are serious, authorizes the deposit and fixes its amount and conditions. 1991, c. 64, a. 1907; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1908. Where, following the alienation of an immovable, the registration of a hypothec against the rent or an assignment of claim, the lessee is not personally informed of the name and address of the new lessor or of the person to whom he owes payment of the rent, he may, with the authorization of the court, deposit his rent in the office of the court.
### Chunk 1570

Deposit may also be authorized where, for any other serious reason, the lessee is not certain of the identity of the person to whom he owes payment of the rent, where the lessor cannot be found or where he refuses payment of the rent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1908. 1909. The court authorizes the remittance of the deposit where the person to whom the lessee owes payment of the rent is identified or has been found or where the lessor performs his obligations; otherwise, it may permit the lessee to continue to deposit his rent until the identification is made or until the lessor performs his obligations.
### Chunk 1571

The court may also authorize the remittance of the deposit to the lessee to enable him to perform the obligations of the lessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1909. § 4. — Condition of dwelling 1910. A lessor is bound to deliver a dwelling in good habitable condition; he is bound to maintain it in that condition throughout the term of the lease. A stipulation whereby a lessee acknowledges that the dwelling is in good habitable condition is without effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1910. 1911. The lessor is bound to deliver the dwelling in clean condition and the lessee is bound to keep it so.
### Chunk 1572

Where the lessor carries out work in the dwelling, he shall restore it to clean condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 1911. 1912. The following give rise to the same remedies as failure to perform an obligation under the lease: (1) failure on the part of the lessor or the lessee to comply with an obligation imposed by law with respect to the safety and sanitation of dwellings; (2) failure on the part of the lessor to comply with the minimum requirements fixed by law with respect to the maintenance, habitability, safety and sanitation of immovables comprising a dwelling.
### Chunk 1573

1991, c. 64, a. 1912. 1913. The lessor may not offer for rent or deliver a dwelling that is unfit for habitation. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 358 of 556 ### Page 359 A dwelling is unfit for habitation if it is in such a condition as to be a serious danger to the health or safety of its occupants or the public, or if it has been declared so by the court or by a competent authority. 1991, c. 64, a. 1913. 1914. A lessee may refuse to take possession of a dwelling delivered to him if it is unfit for habitation; in such a case, the lease is resiliated by operation of law.
### Chunk 1574

1991, c. 64, a. 1914; I. N. 20140501. 1915. A lessee may abandon his dwelling if it becomes unfit for habitation, but he is bound to inform the lessor of the condition of the dwelling before abandoning it or within the following 10 days. A lessee who gives such a notice to the lessor is exempt from rent for the period during which the dwelling is unfit for habitation, unless the condition of the dwelling is the result of his own fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 1915. 1916. As soon as the dwelling becomes fit for habitation again, the lessor is bound to inform the lessee, if the lessee has given him his new address; the lessee is then bound to notify the lessor within the following 10 days as to whether or not he intends to return to the dwelling.
### Chunk 1575

Where the lessee has not given the lessor his new address or fails to notify him that he intends to return to the dwelling, the lease is resiliated by operation of law and the lessor may enter into a lease with a new lessee. 1991, c. 64, a. 1916; I. N. 20140501. 1917. The court, when seized of any dispute in connection with a lease, may, even of its own motion, declare that the dwelling is unfit for habitation; it may then rule on the rent, fix the conditions necessary for the protection of the rights of the lessee and, where applicable, order that the dwelling be made fit for habitation again.
### Chunk 1576

It may also, at the request of the lessee, award punitive damages if the dwelling has become unfit for habitation as a result of negligence on the part of the lessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1917; I. N. 20151101; 2024, c. 2, s. 4. 1918. The lessee may apply to the court for an order enjoining the lessor to perform his obligations regarding the condition of the dwelling, where their nonperformance threatens to make the dwelling unfit for habitation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1918. 1919. The lessee may not, without the consent of the lessor, use or keep in a dwelling a substance which constitutes a risk of fire or explosion and which would lead to an increase in the insurance premiums of the lessor.
### Chunk 1577

1991, c. 64, a. 1919. 1920. The occupants of a dwelling shall be of such a number as to allow each of them to live in normal conditions of comfort and sanitation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1920. 1921. Where a handicapped person significantly limited in his mobility occupies a dwelling, whether or not that person is the lessee, the lessor is bound, at the request of the lessee, to identify the dwelling in CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 359 of 556 ### Page 360 accordance with the Act to secure handicapped persons in the exercise of their rights with a view to achieving social, school and workplace integration (chapter E20.

N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1579

1923. The notice given to the lessee indicates the nature of the work, the date on which it is to begin and an estimate of its duration and, where required, the necessary period of vacancy; it also specifies the amount of the indemnity offered, where applicable, and any other conditions under which the work will be carried out, if they are of such a nature as to cause a substantial reduction of the enjoyment of the premises. The notice shall be given at least 10 days before the date on which the work is to begin or, if a period of vacation of more than one week is necessary, at least three months before that date.
### Chunk 1580

1991, c. 64, a. 1923; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1924. The indemnity due to a lessee by reason of temporary vacation is payable on the date he vacates. If the indemnity proves inadequate, the lessee may be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses incurred beyond the amount of the indemnity. The lessee may also, depending on the circumstances, obtain a reduction of rent or resiliation of the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1924; I. N. 20151101. 1925. If the notice of the lessor provides for temporary vacation, the lessee shall notify the lessor within 10 days after receiving it that he intends or does not intend to comply with it; otherwise, he is deemed to have refused to vacate the premises.
### Chunk 1581

If the lessee refuses to vacate, the lessor may apply to the court within 10 days after the refusal for a ruling on the expediency of the vacation. 1991, c. 64, a. 1925; I. N. 20151101. 1926. Where temporary vacation is not required or the lessee agrees to vacate, the lessee, within 10 days after receiving the notice, may apply to the court for the modification or suppression of any abusive condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 1926; I. N. 20151101. 1927. The application of the lessor or of the lessee is heard and decided by preference.
### Chunk 1582

It suspends the carrying out of the work unless the court orders otherwise. The court may impose such conditions as it considers just and reasonable. 1991, c. 64, a. 1927. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 360 of 556 ### Page 361 1928. Where the court is adjudicating upon an application regarding the conditions under which work is to be carried out, it is for the lessor to show that such work and conditions are reasonable and that the vacancy is necessary.
### Chunk 1583

1991, c. 64, a. 1928; I. N. 20140501. 1929. No notice is required and no contestation is allowed where the alterations made have been the subject of an agreement between the lessor and the lessee within the scope of a public housing preservation and restoration program. 1991, c. 64, a. 1929. § 6. — Access to and visit of dwelling 1930.

The lessee may, except in case of emergency, refuse to allow the dwelling to be visited by a prospective lessee or acquirer before 9 a. m. or after 9 p. m. ; the same rule applies where the lessor wishes to ascertain the condition of the dwelling.
### Chunk 1585

The lessee may, in all cases, refuse to allow the dwelling to be visited if the lessor is unable to be present. 1991, c. 64, a. 1932; I. N. 20140501. 1933. The lessee may not refuse to allow the lessor to have access to the dwelling to carry out work. He may deny him access before 7 a. m. and after 7 p. m. , however, unless the work is urgent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1933. 1934.

N. 20140501. 1936. Every lessee has a personal right to maintain occupancy; he may not be evicted from the leased dwelling, except in the cases provided for by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 1936. 1937. The voluntary or forced alienation of an immovable comprising a dwelling or the extinction of the title of the lessor does not permit the new lessor to resiliate the lease, which is continued and may be renewed in the same manner as any other lease.
### Chunk 1588

The new lessor has, towards the lessee, the rights and obligations resulting from the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1937. 1938. The married or civil union spouse of a lessee, or a person who has been living with the lessee for at least six months, being the de facto spouse of the lessee, a relative or a person connected to the lessee by marriage or a civil union, is entitled to maintain occupancy and becomes the lessee if he or she continues to occupy the dwelling after the cessation of cohabitation and gives notice to that effect to the lessor within two months after the cessation of cohabitation.
### Chunk 1589

A person living with the lessee at the time of death of the lessee has the same right and becomes the lessee if he or she continues to occupy the dwelling and gives notice to that effect to the lessor within two months after the death. If the person does not avail himself or herself of this right, the liquidator of the succession or, failing him or her, an heir may, in the month which follows the expiry of the period of two months, resiliate the lease by giving notice of one month to that effect to the lessor.
### Chunk 1590

In all cases, if part of the rent covers services of a personal nature provided to the lessee, the person living with the lessee at the time of the lessee’s death, the liquidator of the succession or the heir is only required to pay that part of the rent that relates to the services which were provided during the lifetime of the lessee. The same applies to the cost of such services if they are provided by the lessor under a contract separate from the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1938; 2002, c.
### Chunk 1591

6, s. 52; 2011, c. 29, s. 4; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 220. 1939. If no one is living with the lessee at the time of his or her death, the liquidator of the succession or, if there is no liquidator, an heir may resiliate the lease by giving the lessor two months’ notice within six months after the death. The resiliation takes effect before the twomonth period expires if the liquidator or the heir and the lessor so agree or when the dwelling is released by the lessor during that same period.
### Chunk 1592

If part of the rent covers the cost of services of a personal nature provided to the lessee, the liquidator or the heir is only required to pay that part of the rent that relates to the services which were provided during the lifetime of the lessee. The same applies to the cost of such services if they are provided by the lessor under a contract separate from the lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1939; 2011, c. 29, s. 5. 1940. The sublessee of a dwelling is not entitled to maintain occupancy.
### Chunk 1593

The sublease terminates not later than the date on which the lease of the dwelling terminates; however, the sublessee is not bound to vacate the premises before receiving 10 days’ notice to that effect from the sublessor or, failing him, from the principal lessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 1940; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 362 of 556 ### Page 363 II. — Renewal and modification of lease 1941. A lessee entitled to maintain occupancy and having a lease with a fixed term is entitled by operation of law to its renewal at term.
### Chunk 1594

The lease is renewed at term on the same conditions and for the same term or, if the term of the initial lease exceeds 12 months, for a term of 12 months. The parties may, however, agree on a different renewal term. 1991, c. 64, a. 1941; I. N. 20140501. 1942. At the renewal of the lease, the lessor may modify its conditions, particularly the term or the rent, but only if he gives notice of the modification to the lessee not less than three months nor more than six months before term.
### Chunk 1595

If the term of the lease is less than 12 months, the notice shall be given not less than one month nor more than two months before term. A lessor may not modify a lease with an indeterminate term unless he gives the lessee a notice of not less than one month nor more than two months. The notice is of not less than 10 days nor more than 20 days in the case of the lease of a room. 1991, c. 64, a. 1942; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1943. In every notice of modification increasing the rent, an indication shall be made of the proposed new rent in dollars or of the increase expressed in dollars or as a percentage of the current rent.
### Chunk 1596

The increase may be expressed as a percentage of the rent that will be determined by the court, where an application to have the rent fixed or reviewed has already been filed. The notice shall, in addition, indicate the proposed term of the lease, if the lessor proposes to modify the term, and the time granted to the lessee to refuse the proposed modification. 1991, c. 64, a. 1943; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1944. The lessor may avoid the renewal of the lease where the lessee has subleased the dwelling for more than 12 months by giving notice, within the same time as for modification of the lease, of his intention to terminate it to the lessee and to the sublessee.
### Chunk 1597

The lessor may similarly avoid the renewal of the lease where the lessee has died and no one was living with him at the time of the death, by giving the notice to the heir or to the liquidator of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 1944. 1944. 1. Within one month after receiving the notice referred to in article 1944, the lessee of a dwelling subleased for more than 12 months is bound to notify the lessor that he refuses to terminate the lease or that he is vacating the dwelling; otherwise, he is deemed to have refused to vacate the dwelling.
### Chunk 1598

2024, c. 2, s. 6. 1945. A lessee who objects to the modification proposed by the lessor is bound to notify the lessor, within one month after receiving the notice of modification of the lease, that he objects or that he is vacating the dwelling; otherwise, he is deemed to have agreed to the renewal of the lease on the conditions proposed by the lessor. In the case of a lease of a dwelling described in article 1955, however, the lessee shall vacate the dwelling upon termination of the lease if he objects to the proposed modification.

1991, c. 64, a. 1945. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 363 of 556 ### Page 364 1946. A lessee who has not received a notice of modification of the conditions of the lease from the lessor may avoid the renewal of a lease with a fixed term or terminate a lease with an indeterminate term by giving notice of nonrenewal or resiliation of the lease to the lessor, within the same time as a lessor giving notice of modification. 1991, c. 64, a. 1946.
### Chunk 1600

III. — Fixing conditions of lease 1947. Where a lessee objects to the proposed modification, the lessor may apply to the court, within one month after receiving the notice of objection, to have the rent fixed or for a ruling on any other modification of the lease, as the case may be. Where a lessee who has subleased his dwelling for more than 12 months refuses to vacate the premises, the lessor may also apply to the court to terminate the lease. If the lessee fails to file an application within one month after the objection or the refusal, the lease is renewed by operation of law on the same conditions.
### Chunk 1601

If the court dismisses the application to terminate the lease but its decision is rendered after the expiry of the time for giving notice of modification of the lease, the lease is renewed but the lessor may, within one month after the final judgment, apply to the court to have a new rent fixed. 1991, c. 64, a. 1947; I. N. 20140501; 2024, c. 2, s. 7. 1948. An heir or the liquidator of the succession of a lessee who has died may, within one month after receiving notice of the intention of the lessor to avoid the renewal of the lease, contest the notice on its merits before the court; otherwise, he is deemed to have agreed to terminate the lease.
### Chunk 1602

Where the court grants the application after the expiry of the time for giving notice of modification of the lease, the lease is renewed but the lessor may, within one month after the final judgment, apply to the court for the fixing of a new rent. 1991, c. 64, a. 1948; 2024, c. 2, s. 8. 1949. Where the lease provides for the adjustment of the rent, the parties may apply to the court to contest the excessive or inadequate nature of the proposed or agreed adjustment and for the fixing of the rent.
### Chunk 1603

The application shall be made within one month from the date on which the adjustment is to take effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1949. 1950. A new lessee or a sublessee may apply to the court to have the rent fixed if his rent is higher than the lowest rent paid during the 12 months preceding the beginning of the lease or sublease, as the case may be, unless that rent has already been fixed by the court. He may apply only within 10 days after the lease or sublease has been entered into. If at the time the lease or sublease is entered into he has not received the notice from the lessor indicating the lowest rent paid in the preceding year, he may apply not later than two months after the beginning of the lease or sublease; where the lessor has given a notice containing a misrepresentation, the new lessee or sublessee may apply not later than two months after becoming aware of that fact.
### Chunk 1604

1991, c. 64, a. 1950; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 1951. A person entitled by law to maintain occupancy and to become lessee upon the cessation of cohabitation with the lessee or the death of the lessee is not considered to be a new lessee. 1991, c. 64, a. 1951. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 364 of 556 ### Page 365 1952. Where the court authorizes the modification of a condition of a lease, it fixes the rent payable for the dwelling, taking into consideration the relative value of the modification in relation to the rent for the dwelling.
### Chunk 1605

1991, c. 64, a. 1952. 1953. Where the court has an application before it for the fixing or adjustment of rent, it takes into consideration the standards prescribed by regulation. The rent fixed by the court is in force for the term of the renewed lease or for such term, not in excess of 12 months, as it determines. If the court grants an increase of rent, it may spread the payment of the arrears over a period not exceeding the term of the renewed lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1953. 1954.
### Chunk 1606

Where the court fixes the rent on the application of a new lessee, it does so for the term of the lease. Where the term of the lease exceeds 12 months, the lessor may nevertheless have the rent fixed annually. The application must be made not later than three months before the expiry of each period of 12 months from the date on which the fixed rent took effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 1954; I. N. 20140501. 1955. Neither the lessor nor the lessee of a dwelling leased by a housing cooperative to one of its members may apply to the court to have the rent fixed or any other condition of the lease modified.
### Chunk 1607

Similarly, the lessor or the lessee of a dwelling situated in a recently erected immovable or an immovable used for rental as a result of a recent change of destination may not pursue such a remedy within five years after the date on which the immovable is ready for its intended use. Those restrictions may not be set up by the lessor against the lessee unless they are set out in the lease and, in the case of a dwelling referred to in the second paragraph, unless the lease indicates the maximum rent that the lessor may impose in the five years after the date on which the immovable is ready for its intended use.
### Chunk 1608

The above rules do not apply in the case of a dwelling that has been the subject of a change of destination referred to in article 1955. 1. 1991, c. 64, a. 1955; I. N. 20140501; 2022, c. 25, s. 2; 2024, c. 2, s. 9. 1955. 1. Where a dwelling situated in a private seniors’ residence or in another lodging facility where services of a personal nature provided to the lessee are provided to seniors is the subject of a change of destination while remaining offered for dwelling purposes, the rent stipulated in the first lease entered into following the change must correspond to the rent that was charged under the previous lease, less the part of the rent relating to the cost of the services, including services of a personal nature provided to the lessee, accessories, dependencies and other benefits that will no longer be provided under the new lease.

The lessor may not require any amount of money from the lessee by reason of the alienation or lease of the mobile home, unless he acts as the mandatary of the lessee for alienation or lease. 1991, c. 64, a. 1999. 2000. The acquirer of a mobile home situated on leased land becomes the lessee of the land unless he notifies the lessor of his intention to leave the premises within one month after the acquisition.

1991, c. 64, a. 2000. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 374 of 556 ### Page 375 CHAPTER V AFFREIGHTMENT DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS 2001. Affreightment is a contract by which a person, the lessor, undertakes for a price, also called freight, to place all or part of a ship at the disposal of another person, the charterer, for navigation. The contract, if in writing, is evidenced by a charterparty containing the names of the parties, their undertakings under the contract and particulars identifying the ship.
### Chunk 1658

1991, c. 64, a. 2001; I. N. 20140501. 2002. The charterer is bound to pay freight. If no price has been agreed, he shall pay an amount consistent with market conditions, at the place and time the contract is entered into. 1991, c. 64, a. 2002; I. N. 20140501. 2003. Where the lessor has not been paid at the time of discharge of the cargo from the ship, he may retain the property carried until payment of what is due to him, including for reasonable expenses and injury resulting from the retention.
### Chunk 1659

1991, c. 64, a. 2003; I. N. 20140501. 2004. General average is governed by conventional maritime rules and customs, at the place and time the contract is entered into. 1991, c. 64, a. 2004; I. N. 20140501. 2005. The charterer may subcharter the ship with the consent of the lessor or use it for carriage under bills of lading; in either case, he remains liable to the lessor for his obligations under the contract of affreightment. The lessor may, to the extent of what is due to him by the charterer, bring action against the subcharterer for payment of the freight due by the latter, but the subchartering of the ship establishes no other direct relationship between the lessor and the subcharterer.
### Chunk 1660

1991, c. 64, a. 2005; I. N. 20140501. 2006. Prescription of an action arising out of a contract of affreightment runs, in the case of a bareboat or time charter, from the expiry of the term of the contract or the permanent interruption of its performance and, in the case of a voyage charter, from the completion of the discharge of the property carried or from the event which put an end to the voyage. Prescription of an action arising out of a contract of subcharter runs under the same conditions.

1991, c. 64, a. 2007; I. N. 20140501. 2008. The lessor delivers the ship in a seaworthy condition and fit for the service for which it is intended, at the agreed place and time. 1991, c. 64, a. 2008. 2009. The charterer may use the ship for any purpose consistent with the ship’s normal destination, but the lessor may, in the contract, impose restrictions as to that use. 1991, c. 64, a. 2009; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 222. 2010. The charterer may use the ship’s stores and equipment.

He insures the ship and bears all operating costs. He hires and maintains the crew. 1991, c. 64, a. 2010. 2011. The charterer is bound to warrant the lessor against all remedies of third persons arising out of the operation of the ship. 1991, c. 64, a. 2011. 2012. The charterer is bound to maintain the ship and make the necessary repairs and replacements. The lessor is bound to make the repairs and replacements arising from inherent defects whose effects appear within one year after delivery of the ship to the charterer and, if the ship is immobilized for more than 24 hours by reason of such a defect, no freight is payable by the charterer for the time during which the ship is immobilized.
### Chunk 1664

1991, c. 64, a. 2012; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2013.

He is bound, however, to redeliver stores, provisions and equipment of the same quantity and quality as those he received when the ship was delivered to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2013; I.
### Chunk 1665

N. 20140501. § 2. — Time charter 2014. A time charter is a contract by which a lessor places a fullyequipped and manned ship at the disposal of a charterer for a fixed time and under which he retains the nautical management of the ship but transfers its commercial management to the charterer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2014; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 376 of 556 ### Page 377 2015. The lessor delivers the ship in a seaworthy condition and properly manned and equipped for the service for which it is intended, at the agreed place and time.
### Chunk 1666

1991, c. 64, a. 2015. 2016. The charterer bears the cost of the commercial operation of the ship, in particular wharfage, pilotage and canal dues. He acquires and pays for the fuel on board when the ship is delivered to him and thereafter provides and pays for fuel of such a grade as to ensure the proper working of the ship. 1991, c. 64, a. 2016. 2017. The master of the ship shall, within the limits stipulated in the contract, follow the instructions of the charterer with respect to the commercial management of the ship.
### Chunk 1667

If the instructions are inconsistent with the rights of the lessor under the contract, the master may refuse to follow them. If he follows them, he does so without prejudice to the lessor’s remedy against the charterer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2017; I. N. 20140501. 2018. The charterer is bound to indemnify the lessor for any loss or damage caused to the ship as a result of its commercial operation, fair wear and tear excepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2018; I. N. 20140501. 2019. Freight runs from the day the ship is delivered to the charterer, in accordance with the terms of the contract.
### Chunk 1668

Freight is payable until the day the ship is redelivered to the lessor; it is not payable, however, for periods during which the working of the ship is impeded by superior force or by a cause attributable to a third person or to the lessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2019; I. N. 20140501. 2020. The charterer redelivers the ship at the agreed place and within the agreed time; he gives reasonable prior notice to the lessor. If no place has been agreed for the redelivery of the ship, it is redelivered at the place where it was delivered.
### Chunk 1669

1991, c. 64, a. 2020; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 3. — Voyage charter 2021. A voyage charter is a contract by which a lessor places all or part of a fullyequipped and manned ship at the disposal of a charterer for the carriage of cargo on one or more specified voyages and under which he retains the nautical and commercial management of the ship. The contract specifies the nature and quantity of the cargo as well as the places of loading and discharge and the time allowed for those operations.
### Chunk 1670

1991, c. 64, a. 2021; I. N. 20140501. 2022. The lessor presents the ship in a seaworthy condition and properly manned and equipped for the voyage, at the agreed place and time. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 377 of 556 ### Page 378 Moreover, he is bound to maintain the ship in a seaworthy condition and to use all diligence within his means to prosecute the voyage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2022. 2023. The lessor is responsible, within the limits stipulated in the contract, for loss of or damage to the property received on board.
### Chunk 1671

He may, however, relieve himself from that liability by proving that the damage did not result from failure on his part to perform his obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 2023; I. N. 20140501. 2024. The charterer is bound to load cargo of the agreed quality in the agreed quantity; if he does not, he is nevertheless bound to pay the stipulated freight. The charterer may, however, resiliate the contract before loading begins; in that case, he shall pay to the lessor an indemnity equal to the injury he suffers, but in no case greater than the amount of the freight.
### Chunk 1672

1991, c. 64, a. 2024; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2025. The charterer shall load and discharge the cargo within the time allowed by the contract or, if the contract does not specify a time, within a reasonable time or according to the custom of the port. Where the times for loading and discharging are fixed separately by the contract, they are not reversible and the time for each operation is computed separately. 1991, c. 64, a. 2025; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101.
### Chunk 1673

2026. The time for loading or discharging runs from the moment the lessor informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or ready to discharge, after its arrival at the port. 1991, c. 64, a. 2026; I. N. 20140501. 2027. Where a time allowed for loading or discharging is exceeded for any reason not attributable to the lessor, the charterer shall pay demurrage from the expiry of the time allowed; demurrage is considered a supplement to freight and is payable for the entire additional time actually required for loading or discharging.
### Chunk 1674

Demurrage not fixed by the contract is calculated at a reasonable rate, according to the custom of the port of loading or discharge or, failing that, according to maritime customs. 1991, c. 64, a. 2027; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 223. 2028. Freight is payable on completion of the voyage. However, it is not due in all circumstances. Where completion of the voyage becomes impossible, the charterer is bound to pay freight only if the cause is not attributable to the lessor.
### Chunk 1675

In that case, freight is due only proportionately to the distance travelled. 1991, c. 64, a. 2028; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2029. The contract is resolved by operation of law, with no claim for damages on either part, if superior force renders the voyage impossible before its commencement. The contract stands, however, if superior force prevents the sailing of the ship or the prosecution of the voyage for a time only; in that case, no reduction of freight or damages may be claimed by reason of the delay.

N. 20140501. 2032. Except where it is effected by a carrier offering his services to the public in the ordinary course of business of his enterprise, gratuitous carriage of a person or property is not governed by the rules contained in this chapter and the carrier is bound only by an obligation of prudence and diligence.
### Chunk 1678

1991, c. 64, a. 2032; I. N. 20151101. 2033. A carrier who provides services to the general public shall carry any person requesting it and any property he is requested to carry, unless he has serious cause for refusal; the passenger, shipper or receiver is bound to follow the instructions given by the carrier, in accordance with the law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2033; I. N. 20140501. 2034. A carrier may not exclude or limit his liability except to the extent and subject to the conditions established by law.
### Chunk 1679

He is bound to make reparation for injury resulting from delay, unless he proves superior force. 1991, c. 64, a. 2034; I. N. 20140501. 2035. Where the carrier entrusts another carrier with the performance of all or part of his obligation, the substitute carrier is deemed to be a party to the contract. The shipper is discharged by payment to one of the carriers. 1991, c. 64, a. 2035. § 2. — Carriage of persons 2036. Carriage of persons includes, in addition to carriage itself, embarking and disembarking operations.
### Chunk 1680

1991, c. 64, a. 2036. 2037. The carrier is bound to convey his passengers safe and sound to their destination.

### Chunk 1681

1991, c. 64, a. 2037; I. N. 20140501. 2038. The carrier is liable for any loss of the luggage or other effects placed in his care by a passenger, unless he proves superior force, an inherent defect in the property or the fault of the passenger. However, the carrier is not liable for any loss of documents, money or other property of great value, unless he agreed to carry the property after its nature or value was declared to him; moreover, the carrier is not liable for any loss of hand luggage or other effects which remain in the care of the passenger, unless the passenger proves the fault of the carrier.
### Chunk 1682

1991, c. 64, a. 2038. 2039. In the case of successive or combined carriage of persons, the carrier who effects the carriage in the course of which the injury occurs is liable therefor, unless one of the carriers has, by express stipulation, assumed liability for the entire journey. 1991, c. 64, a. 2039; I. N. 20140501. § 3. — Carriage of property 2040. Carriage of property extends from the time the carrier receives the property into his charge for carriage until its delivery.
### Chunk 1683

1991, c. 64, a. 2040. 2041. A bill of lading is a writing which evidences a contract for the carriage of property. A bill of lading states, in particular, the names of the shipper, receiver and carrier and, where applicable, of the person who is to pay the freight and carriage charges. It also states the place and date of receipt of the property by the carrier into his charge, the points of origin and destination, the freight as well as the nature, quantity, volume or weight and apparent condition of the property and any dangerous properties it may have.
### Chunk 1684

1991, c. 64, a. 2041; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 224. 2042. The bill of lading is issued in several copies; the issuing carrier keeps a copy and gives one to the shipper; another copy accompanies the property to its destination. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the bill of lading is proof of the receipt of the property by the carrier into his charge and of its nature, quantity and apparent condition. 1991, c. 64, a. 2042. 2043. A bill of lading is not negotiable, unless otherwise provided by law or by the contract.
### Chunk 1685

Negotiation of a negotiable bill of lading is effected by endorsement and delivery, or by mere delivery if the bill is made to bearer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2043. 2044. The carrier is bound to deliver the property to the receiver or to the holder of the bill of lading. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 380 of 556 ### Page 381 The holder of a bill of lading is bound to hand it over to the carrier when he demands delivery of the property. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1686

64, a. 2044; I. N. 20140501. 2045. Subject to the rights of the shipper, the receiver upon accepting the property or the contract acquires the rights and assumes the obligations arising out of the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2045. 2046. The carrier is bound to notify the receiver of the arrival of the property and of the time allowed to remove it, unless it is delivered to the receiver’s residence or premises. 1991, c. 64, a. 2046. 2047. Where the receiver cannot be found or refuses or neglects to take delivery of the property or where, for any other reason, the carrier cannot deliver the property through no fault of his own, the carrier shall notify the shipper without delay and request instructions as to disposal of the property; in an emergency, however, the carrier may dispose of perishable property without notice.
### Chunk 1687

If the carrier receives no instructions within 15 days of notification, he may return the property to the shipper at the shipper’s expense or dispose of it in accordance with the rules contained in Book Four on Property concerning the holder of property entrusted and forgotten. 1991, c. 64, a. 2047. 2048. From the expiry of the time allowed for removal or from notification of the shipper, the obligations of the carrier are those of a gratuitous depositary; he is entitled, however, to reasonable remuneration for the preservation and storage of the property, payable by the receiver or, failing him, by the shipper.
### Chunk 1688

1991, c. 64, a. 2048. 2049. The carrier is bound to carry the property to its destination. He is bound to make reparation for injury resulting from the carriage, unless he proves that the loss was caused by superior force, an inherent defect in the property or natural shrinkage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2049; I. N. 20140501. 2050. Prescription of any action for damages against a carrier runs from the delivery of the property or from the date on which it should have been delivered.
### Chunk 1689

The action is not admissible unless a notice of the claim was first given to the carrier in writing within 60 days after the delivery of the property, whether or not the loss sustained by the property is apparent, or if the property is not delivered, within nine months after the date on which it was shipped. No notice is required if the action is brought within that time. 1991, c. 64, a. 2050; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2051. In the case of successive or combined carriage of property, an action in liability may be brought against the carrier with whom the contract was made or the last carrier.
### Chunk 1690

1991, c. 64, a. 2051. 2052. The liability of the carrier, in the case of loss, may not exceed the value of the property declared by the shipper. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 381 of 556 ### Page 382 If no value has been declared, it is determined on the basis of the value of the property at the place and time of shipment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2052; I. N. 20151101. 2053. No carrier is bound to carry documents, money or property of great value.
### Chunk 1691

If a carrier agrees to carry that type of property, he is not liable for loss unless its nature or value has been declared to him; any deceitful declaration which misleads as to the nature of the property or inflates its value exempts the carrier from all liability. 1991, c. 64, a. 2053; I. N. 20140501. 2054. A shipper who places dangerous property into the charge of a carrier without prior disclosure of its exact nature shall indemnify the carrier for any injury he suffers by reason of carriage of the property.
### Chunk 1692

In addition, the shipper shall pay any storage charges for the property and assume all the risks attached to it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2054; I. N. 20140501. 2055. The shipper is bound to make reparation for injury suffered by the carrier as a result of an inherent defect in the property or any omission, deficiency or inaccuracy in the shipper’s declarations as to the property carried. However, the carrier remains liable to third persons who suffer injury as a result of any of these acts or omissions, subject to his remedy against the shipper.
### Chunk 1693

1991, c. 64, a. 2055; I. N. 20140501. 2056. The freight and carriage charges are payable before delivery, unless otherwise stipulated in the bill of lading. In either case, if the property is not of the same nature as that described in the contract or if its value is greater than the declared amount, the carrier may claim the amount he could have charged for its carriage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2056; 2016, c. 4, s. 225. 2057. Where the price of the property carried is payable on delivery, the carrier shall not deliver the property until he receives payment.
### Chunk 1694

The shipper pays the charges unless he has instructed otherwise on the bill of lading. 1991, c. 64, a. 2057. 2058. The carrier may retain the property carried until the freight, the carriage charges and any reasonable storage charges are paid. If, according to the shipper’s instructions, those amounts are payable by the receiver and the carrier does not demand payment of them, he loses his right to claim them from the shipper. 1991, c. 64, a. 2058; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 382 of 556 ### Page 383 DIVISION II SPECIAL RULES GOVERNING CARRIAGE OF PROPERTY BY WATER § 1.
### Chunk 1695

N. 20140501. 2061. Freight is payable by the shipper.
### Chunk 1696

Freight is also payable by the receiver where he takes delivery of property for which freight is payable on arrival. 1991, c. 64, a. 2061; I. N. 20140501. 2062. The shipper shall present the property at the time and place fixed by agreement between the parties or according to the custom of the port of loading, failing which he shall pay to the carrier an indemnity equal to the injury he suffers, but in no case greater than the amount of the freight. 1991, c. 64, a. 2062; I. N.
### Chunk 1697

20140501. 2063. At the beginning of the voyage and even before, the carrier is bound to exercise diligence to make the ship seaworthy, properly man, equip and supply it, and make fit and safe all parts of the ship where property is to be loaded and kept during the voyage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2063. 2064. The carrier is bound to proceed in an appropriate manner with the loading, handling, stowing, carrying, keeping in custody and discharging of the property carried. Except in the coasting trade, a fault is committed by the carrier if, without the consent of the shipper and in the absence of rules or custom so permitting, he stows the property on deck.
### Chunk 1698

Consent is presumed where containers are loaded on a ship fit for that kind of carriage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2064; I. N. 20140501. 2065. The carrier shall issue to the shipper, at his request, a bill of lading based on the declarations of the shipper. In addition to the usual particulars, such a bill of lading contains entries allowing the property to be carried to be clearly identified, including the leading marks appearing on it, and any relevant information. The carrier may refuse to include in the bill of lading any particular whose accuracy he has serious reason to suspect or which he has had no means of checking.
### Chunk 1699

1991, c. 64, a. 2065; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 383 of 556 ### Page 384 2066. The shipper warrants the accuracy of his declarations at the time of shipment and is liable for any injury the carrier may suffer as a result of inaccuracies in his declarations. The carrier may exercise his rights under this article only against the shipper. 1991, c. 64, a. 2066; I. N. 20140501. 2067. Where the nature or value of the property is knowingly misstated by the shipper, the carrier is not liable for any loss.
### Chunk 1700

1991, c. 64, a. 2067. 2068. Removal of the property creates a presumption that the property was delivered to the receiver in the condition indicated in the bill of lading or, failing such an indication, in its condition at the time of shipment, unless the receiver gives notice in writing of any loss with respect to the property to the carrier or to his representative at the port of discharge, not later than upon removal or, if the loss is not apparent, within three days of removal. The carrier and the receiver may, at the time of removal, require a statement as to the condition of the property.
### Chunk 1701

1991, c. 64, a. 2068; I. N. 20140501. 2069. In the case of any actual or apprehended loss with respect to the property, the carrier and the receiver are bound to give each other facilities for inspecting and tallying the parcels. 1991, c. 64, a. 2069; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2070. Any stipulation in a contract whereby the carrier or the lessor is relieved from the obligation to make reparation for injury resulting from the loss sustained by the property carried, except in the case of carriage of live animals or property stowed on deck other than containers loaded on a ship fitted for the carriage of containers, is null.
### Chunk 1702

Any clause assigning the benefit of insurance to the carrier or any similar clause is considered to be a stipulation relieving the carrier from liability. 1991, c. 64, a. 2070. 2071.

### Chunk 1705

He may be held liable in excess of the amount fixed by regulation if he committed fraud or if the nature and value of the property were declared by the shipper before shipment and the declaration was attached to the bill of lading. The shipper’s declaration is binding on the carrier, saving his right to make proof to the contrary. 1991, c. 64, a. 2074; I. N. 20140501. 2075. No freight is payable for property lost by reason of perils of the sea or negligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy.

Where dangerous property shipped with the knowledge and consent of the carrier becomes a danger to the ship or cargo, it may be landed, destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without any liability on his part except by way of general average, if any.
### Chunk 1707

1991, c. 64, a. 2077. 2078.

N. 20140501. 2079.

The handling contractor may be exonerated from liability for any loss with respect to property for the same reasons as the carrier; however, the plaintiff may in those cases establish that the loss is due to the fault of the handling contractor or his subordinates. In no case may the liability of the handling contractor exceed the sum fixed by government regulation, unless he committed fraud or has been notified of a declaration of the value of the property.
### Chunk 1711

1991, c. 64, a. 2083; I. N. 20140501. 2084. No clause for the purpose or to the effect of relieving the handling contractor from liability, shifting the burden of proof which lies upon him, limiting his liability to a sum lower than that fixed by regulation or assigning the benefit of insurance to him may be set up against the shipper or the receiver. 1991, c. 64, a. 2084; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER VII CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT 2085. A contract of employment is a contract by which a person, the employee, undertakes, for a limited time and for remuneration, to do work under the direction or control of another person, the employer.
### Chunk 1712

1991, c. 64, a. 2085; 2016, c. 4, s. 227. 2086. A contract of employment is for a fixed term or an indeterminate term. 1991, c. 64, a. 2086. 2087.

The employee is bound not only to perform his work with prudence and diligence, but also to act faithfully and honestly and not use any confidential information he obtains in the performance or in the course of his work.
### Chunk 1713

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 386 of 556 ### Page 387 These obligations continue for a reasonable time after the contract terminates and permanently where the information concerns the reputation and privacy of others. 1991, c. 64, a. 2088; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2089. The parties may stipulate in writing and in express terms that, even after the termination of the contract, the employee may neither compete with his employer nor participate in any capacity whatsoever in an enterprise which would compete with him.
### Chunk 1714

However, the stipulation shall be limited as to time, place and type of employment, to what is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the employer. The burden of proof that the stipulation is valid is on the employer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2089; I. N. 20140501. 2090. A contract of employment is tacitly renewed for an indeterminate term where the employee continues to carry on his work for five days after the expiry of the term, without objection from the employer.
### Chunk 1715

1991, c. 64, a. 2090. 2091. Either party to a contract for an indeterminate term may terminate it by giving notice of termination to the other party.

An employer may not avail himself of a stipulation of noncompetition if he has resiliated the contract without a serious reason or if he has himself given the employee such a reason for resiliating the contract.
### Chunk 1717

1991, c. 64, a. 2095. 2096.

### Chunk 1719

1991, c. 64, a. 2098; I. N. 20140501. 2099. The contractor or the provider of services is free to choose the means of performing the contract and, with respect to such performance, no relationship of subordination exists between the contractor or the provider of services and the client. 1991, c. 64, a. 2099; I. N. 20140501. 2100. The contractor and the provider of services are bound to act in the best interests of their client, with prudence and diligence. Depending on the nature of the work to be carried out or the service to be supplied, they are also bound to act in accordance with usage and good practice and, where applicable, to ensure that the work carried out or service supplied is in conformity with the contract.
### Chunk 1720

Where they are bound to an obligation of result, they may not be relieved from their liability except by proving superior force. 1991, c. 64, a. 2100; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES § 1. — General provisions applicable to both services and works 2101. Unless a contract has been entered into in view of his personal qualities or unless the very nature of the contract prevents it, the contractor or the provider of services may obtain the assistance of a third person to perform the contract, but its performance remains under his supervision and responsibility.
### Chunk 1721

1991, c. 64, a. 2101; 2016, c. 4, s. 229. 2102.

The contractor or the provider of services supplies the property necessary for the performance of the contract, unless the parties have stipulated that only his work is required.
### Chunk 1722

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 388 of 556 ### Page 389 He shall supply only property of good quality; he is bound by the same warranties with respect to the property as a seller. A contract is a contract of sale, and not a contract of enterprise or for services, where the work or service is merely an accessory in relation to the value of the property supplied. 1991, c. 64, a. 2103; I. N. 20140501. 2104. Where the property is supplied by the client, the contractor or the provider of services is bound to use it with care and to account for its use; where the property is manifestly unfit for its intended use or where it has an apparent or latent defect of which the contractor or the provider of services should be aware, he is bound to inform the client immediately, failing which he is liable for any injury which may result from the use of the property.
### Chunk 1723

1991, c. 64, a. 2104; I. N. 20140501. 2105. If the property necessary for the performance of the contract perishes by superior force, the party that supplied it bears the loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2105; I. N. 20140501. 2106. The price of the work or services is fixed by the contract, by usage or by law or on the basis of the value of the work carried out or the services rendered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2106. 2107. Where the price of the work or services is estimated at the time the contract is entered into, the contractor or the provider of the services shall justify any increase of the price.
### Chunk 1724

The client is bound to pay such increase only to the extent that it results from work, services or expenses that the contractor or the provider of services could not have foreseen at the time the contract was entered into. 1991, c. 64, a. 2107; I. N. 20140501. 2108. Where the price is fixed according to the value of the work performed, the services rendered or the property supplied, the contractor or the provider of services is bound, at the request of the client, to give him an account of the work progress, of the services that have been rendered and of the expenses incurred so far.
### Chunk 1725

1991, c. 64, a. 2108; I. N. 20140501. 2109. Where the price is fixed by the contract, the client shall pay the price agreed, and may not claim a reduction of the price on the ground that the work or service required less effort or cost less than had been foreseen. Similarly, the contractor or the provider of services may not claim an increase of the price for the opposite reason. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the price fixed by the contract remains unchanged notwithstanding any modification of the original terms and conditions of performance.
### Chunk 1726

1991, c. 64, a. 2109. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 389 of 556 ### Page 390 § 2. — Special provisions as to works 1991, c. 64, Sd. 2; I. N. 20140501. I. — General provisions 2110. The client is bound to accept the work when work is completed; work is completed when the work has been produced and is ready to be used for its intended purpose. Acceptance of the work is the act by which the client declares that he accepts it, with or without reservation.
### Chunk 1727

1991, c. 64, a. 2110. 2111. The client is not bound to pay the price before the work is accepted. At the time of payment, the client may withhold from the price, until the repairs or corrections are made to the work, a sufficient amount to meet the reservations which he made as to the apparent defects or apparent poor workmanship that existed when he accepted the work. The client may not exercise this right if the contractor furnishes him with sufficient security to secure the performance of his obligations.
### Chunk 1728

1991, c. 64, a. 2111; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 230. 2112. If the parties do not agree on the amount to be withheld and on the work to be completed, an assessment is made by an expert designated by the parties or, failing that, by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 2112; 2016, c. 4, s. 231. 2113. A client who accepts without reservation nevertheless retains his right to pursue his remedies against the contractor in cases of nonapparent defects or nonapparent poor workmanship.
### Chunk 1729

1991, c. 64, a. 2113; I. N. 20140501. 2114. Where the work is performed in successive phases, it may be accepted in parts; the price for each part is payable upon delivery and acceptance of the part; payment creates a presumption that the part has been accepted, unless the sums paid are to be considered as merely partial payments on account of the price. 1991, c. 64, a. 2114; I. N. 20140501. 2115. The contractor is liable for loss of the work occurring before its delivery, unless it is due to the fault of the client or the client is in default for not receiving the work.
### Chunk 1730

However, where the property is supplied by the client, the contractor is not liable for the loss of the work unless it is due to his fault or some other failure on his part. He may not claim the price of his work except where the loss of the work results from an inherent defect in the property supplied or a defect in the property that he was unable to detect, or where the loss is due to the fault of the client. 1991, c. 64, a. 2115; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2116. The prescription of rights to pursue remedies between the parties begins to run only from the time that work is completed, even with respect to work that was subject to reservations at the time of acceptance of the work.
### Chunk 1731

1991, c. 64, a. 2116; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 390 of 556 ### Page 391 II. — Immovable works 2117. At any time during the construction or renovation of an immovable, the client, provided he does not interfere with the work, may examine the progress of the work, the quality of the materials used and of the work performed, and the statement of expenses incurred so far. 1991, c. 64, a. 2117. 2118. Unless they can be relieved from liability, the contractor, the architect, the engineer and the professional technologist who, as the case may be, directed or supervised the work, and the subcontractor with respect to work performed by him, are solidarily liable for the loss of the work occurring within five years after the work was completed, whether the loss results from faulty design, construction or production of the work, or defects in the ground.
### Chunk 1732

1991, c. 64, a. 2118; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 15, s. 57. 2119. The architect, engineer or professional technologist may be relieved from liability only by proving that the defects in the work or in the part of it carried out by him do not result from any error or defect in the expert opinions or plans he may have supplied or from any failure in the direction or supervision of the work. The contractor may be relieved from liability only by proving that the defects result from an error or defect in the expert opinions or plans of the architect, engineer or professional technologist selected by the client.
### Chunk 1733

The subcontractor may be relieved from liability only by proving that the defects result from decisions of the contractor or from the expert opinions or plans of the architect, engineer or professional technologist. Each may, in addition, be relieved from liability by proving that the defects result from decisions imposed by the client in selecting the land or materials, or the subcontractors, experts, or construction methods. 1991, c. 64, a. 2119; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 232; 2020, c.

15, s. 58. 2120. The contractor, the architect, the engineer and the professional technologist, for the work they directed or supervised, and, where applicable, the subcontractor, for the work he performed, are jointly bound to warrant the work for one year against poor workmanship existing at the time of acceptance or discovered within one year after acceptance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2120; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 15, s. 59. 2121. An architect, engineer or professional technologist who does not direct or supervise work is liable only for the loss occasioned by a defect or error in the plans or in the expert opinions he supplied.
### Chunk 1735

1991, c. 64, a. 2121; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 15, s. 60. 2122. During the performance of the work, the contractor may, if so provided in the agreement, require partial payments on account of the price of the contract for the value of the work performed and of the materials needed to produce the work; before doing so, he is bound to furnish the client with a statement of the amounts paid to the subcontractors, to the persons having supplied the materials and to any other person having participated in the work, and of the amounts he still owes them for the completion of the work.
### Chunk 1736

1991, c. 64, a. 2122; I. N. 20140501. 2123. At the time of payment, the client may withhold from the price of the contract an amount sufficient to pay the claims of the workmen, as well as those of the other persons who may enforce a legal hypothec on the immovable work and who have given him notice of their contract with the contractor, in relation to the work performed or the materials or services supplied after the notice was given. The withholding is valid until such time as the contractor gives the client an acquittance of such claims.

2124; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III RESILIATION OF THE CONTRACT 2125. The client may unilaterally resiliate the contract even though the work or provision of service is already in progress. 1991, c. 64, a. 2125. 2126. The contractor or the provider of services may not resiliate the contract unilaterally except for a serious reason, and never at an inopportune moment; otherwise, he is bound to make reparation for injury caused to the client as a result of the resiliation.
### Chunk 1739

Where the contractor or the provider of services resiliates the contract, he is bound to do all that is immediately necessary to prevent any loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2126; I. N. 20140501. 2127. The death of the client does not terminate the contract unless its performance thereby becomes impossible or useless. 1991, c. 64, a. 2127. 2128. The contract is not terminated by the death or incapacity of the contractor or the provider of services unless it has been entered into in view of his personal qualities or cannot be adequately continued by the person who succeeds him in his activities, in which case the client may resiliate it.
### Chunk 1740

1991, c. 64, a. 2128; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 233. 2129.

For his part, the contractor or the provider of services is bound to repay any advances he has received in excess of what he has earned.
### Chunk 1741

In either case, each party is liable for any other injury that the other party may have suffered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2129; I. N. 20140501.

Mandate is a contract by which a person, the mandator, confers upon another person, the mandatary, the power to represent him in the performance of a juridical act with a third person, and the mandatary, by his acceptance, binds himself to exercise the power.
### Chunk 1742

That power and, where applicable, the writing evidencing it are also called power of attorney. 1991, c. 64, a. 2130; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 234. 2131. The object of the mandate may also be the performance of acts intended to ensure the personal protection of the mandator, the administration, in whole or in part, of his patrimony and, generally, his moral and material wellbeing, should he become incapable of taking care of himself or administering his property. 1991, c.

64, a. 2131; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2132. Acceptance of a mandate may be express or tacit. Tacit acceptance may be inferred from the acts and even from the silence of the mandatary. 1991, c. 64, a. 2132. 2133. A mandate is either by gratuitous title or by onerous title. A mandate entered into between two natural persons is presumed to be by gratuitous title, but a professional mandate is presumed to be by onerous title. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1744

2133; I. N. 20140501. 2134. The remuneration, if any, is determined by the contract, usage or law, or on the basis of the value of the services rendered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2134; I. N. 20140501. 2135. A mandate may be special, for a particular matter, or general, for all the affairs of the mandator. A mandate expressed in general terms confers the power to perform acts of simple administration only. The power to perform other acts is conferred only by express mandate, except where, in the case of a protection mandate, that mandate confers full administration.
### Chunk 1745

1991, c. 64, a. 2135; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 2136. The powers of a mandatary extend not only to what is expressed in the mandate, but also to anything that may be inferred therefrom. The mandatary may carry out all acts which are incidental to such powers and which are necessary for the performance of the mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2136. 2137. Powers that are granted to persons to perform an act not outside the scope of their profession or duties, but that may be inferred from the nature of such profession or duties, need not be mentioned expressly.

In the course of the mandate, the mandatary is bound to inform the mandator, at the mandator’s request or where circumstances warrant it, of the stage reached in the performance of the mandate. The mandatary shall inform the mandator without delay that he has fulfilled his mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2139; I. N. 20140501. 2140. The mandatary is bound to fulfill the mandate himself unless he is authorized by the mandator to appoint another person to perform all or part of it in his place.
### Chunk 1748

If the interests of the mandator so require, however, the mandatary shall appoint a third person to replace him where unforeseen circumstances prevent him from fulfilling the mandate and he is unable to inform the mandator thereof in due time. 1991, c. 64, a. 2140; I. N. 20140501. 2141. The mandatary is accountable for the acts of the person he has appointed without authorization as his substitute as if he had performed them himself; where he was authorized to make such a substitution, he is accountable only for the care with which he selected his substitute and gave him instructions.
### Chunk 1749

In all cases, the mandator has a direct action against the person appointed by the mandatary as his substitute. 1991, c. 64, a. 2141; I. N. 20140501. 2142. In the performance of the mandate, the mandatary, unless prohibited from doing so by the mandator or by usage, may be assisted by another person and delegate powers to him for that purpose. The mandatary remains liable to the mandator for the acts performed by the person who assisted him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2142; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1750

2143. A mandatary who agrees to represent, for the same act, parties whose interests conflict or could conflict shall so inform each of the mandators, unless he is exempted by usage or by the fact that each of the mandators is aware of the double mandate; he shall act impartially towards each of them. Where a mandator was not in a position to know of the double mandate, he may have the act of the mandatary declared null if he suffers injury as a result. 1991, c. 64, a. 2143; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c.
### Chunk 1751

4, s. 235. 2144. Where several mandataries are appointed together for the same matter, the mandate has effect only if it is accepted by all of them. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 394 of 556 ### Page 395 The mandataries shall act jointly for all acts contemplated in the mandate, unless otherwise stipulated or implied by the mandate. They are solidarily bound to perform their obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 2144; I. N. 20140501; I. N.
### Chunk 1752

20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 236. 2145. A mandatary who, alone, exercises powers that he is charged to exercise with another exceeds his powers, unless he has exercised them in a manner more advantageous to the mandator than that agreed upon. 1991, c. 64, a. 2145; I. N. 20140501. 2146. The mandatary may not use for his benefit any information he obtains or any property he is charged with receiving or administering in the performance of his mandate, unless the mandator consents to such use or such use arises from the law or the mandate.
### Chunk 1753

If the mandatary uses the property or information without authorization, he shall indemnify the mandator by paying, in addition to any indemnity for which he may be liable for injury suffered, in the case of information, an amount equal to the enrichment he obtains or, in the case of property, appropriate rent or the interest on the sums used. 1991, c. 64, a. 2146; I. N. 20140501. 2147. The mandatary may not, even through an intermediary, become a party to an act which he has agreed to perform for his mandator, unless the mandator authorizes it or is aware of his quality as a contracting party.
### Chunk 1754

Only the mandator may avail himself of the nullity resulting from the violation of this rule. 1991, c. 64, a. 2147. 2148. Where the mandate is by gratuitous title, the court may, after assessing the extent of the mandatary’s liability, reduce the amount of damages for which he is liable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2148. § 2. — Obligations of the mandator towards the mandatary 2149. The mandator is bound to cooperate with the mandatary to facilitate the fulfilment of the mandate. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1755

64, a. 2149. 2150. Where required, the mandator advances to the mandatary the necessary sums for the performance of the mandate. He reimburses the mandatary for any reasonable expenses he has incurred and pays him the remuneration to which he is entitled. 1991, c. 64, a. 2150. 2151. The mandator owes interest on expenses incurred by the mandatary in the performance of his mandate from the day they are disbursed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2151. 2152. The mandator is bound to discharge the mandatary from the obligations he has contracted towards third persons within the limits of the mandate.
### Chunk 1756

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 395 of 556 ### Page 396 The mandator is not liable to the mandatary for any act which exceeds the limits of the mandate. He is fully liable, however, if he ratifies such act or if the mandatary, at the time he acted, was unaware that the mandate had terminated. 1991, c. 64, a. 2152. 2153. The mandator is presumed to have ratified an act which exceeds the limits of the mandate where the act has been performed in a manner more advantageous to him than the one he had indicated.
### Chunk 1757

1991, c. 64, a. 2153; I. N. 20140501. 2154. Where the mandatary has not committed any fault, the mandator is bound to indemnify him for any injury he has suffered by reason of the performance of the mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2154; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 237. 2155. If no fault is attributable to the mandatary, the sums owed to him are payable even though the matter was not successfully concluded. 1991, c. 64, a. 2155; I. N. 20140501. 2156. If a mandate is given by several persons, their obligations towards the mandatary are solidary.
### Chunk 1758

1991, c. 64, a. 2156. DIVISION III OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TOWARDS THIRD PERSONS 1991, c. 64, Div. III; I. N. 20140501. § 1. — Obligations of the mandatary towards third persons 2157. A mandatary who binds himself, within the limits of his mandate, in the name and on behalf of the mandator, is not personally liable to the third person with whom he contracts. The mandatary is liable to the third person if he acts in his own name, subject to any rights the third person may have against the mandator.
### Chunk 1759

1991, c. 64, a. 2157; I. N. 20140501. 2158. A mandatary who exceeds his powers is personally liable to the third person with whom he contracts, unless the third person was sufficiently aware of the mandate, or unless the mandator has ratified the acts performed by the mandatary. 1991, c. 64, a. 2158; I. N. 20140501. 2159. A mandatary who agrees with a third person to disclose the identity of his mandator within a fixed period and fails to do so, binds himself personally.
### Chunk 1760

A mandatary also binds himself personally if he is bound to withhold the name of the mandator or knows, but fails to mention, that the person whose identity he discloses is insolvent, is a minor or is under tutorship to a person of full age or under a protection mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2159; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 81. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 396 of 556 ### Page 397 § 2. — Obligations of the mandator towards third persons 2160.
### Chunk 1761

A mandator is liable to third persons for the acts performed by the mandatary in the performance and within the limits of his mandate unless, under the agreement or by virtue of usage, the mandatary alone is liable. The mandator is also liable for any acts which exceeded the limits of the mandate, if he has ratified them. 1991, c. 64, a. 2160; I. N. 20140501. 2161. The mandator may, if he suffers injury thereby, repudiate the acts of the person appointed by the mandatary as his substitute where the substitution was made without the mandator’s authorization or where the mandator’s interest or the circumstances did not warrant the substitution.
### Chunk 1762

1991, c. 64, a. 2161; I. N. 20140501. 2162. The mandator or, upon his death, his heirs are liable to third persons for acts performed by the mandatary in the performance and within the limits of the mandate after the termination of the mandate, where the acts were the necessary consequence of those already performed or could not be deferred without risk of loss, or where the third person was unaware of the termination of the mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2162; I. N. 20140501; I.
### Chunk 1763

N. 20151101. 2163. Where a person has allowed it to be believed that another person was his mandatary, he is liable, as if there had been a mandate, to a third person who in good faith has contracted with that other person, unless he took appropriate measures to prevent the error in circumstances in which it was foreseeable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2163; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2164. A mandator is liable for any injury caused by the fault of the mandatary in the performance of his mandate unless he proves, where the mandatary was not his subordinate, that he could not have prevented the injury.
### Chunk 1764

1991, c. 64, a. 2164; I. N. 20140501. 2165. A mandator, after disclosing to a third person the mandate he had given, may take action directly against the third person for the performance of the obligations contracted by that person towards the mandatary who had acted in his own name. However, the third person may plead the inconsistency of the mandate with the stipulations or nature of his contract, as well as the defenses which can be set up against the mandator and the mandatary respectively.
### Chunk 1765

If proceedings have already been instituted against the third person by the mandatary, the mandator may exercise his right only by intervening in the proceedings. 1991, c. 64, a. 2165; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION IV SPECIAL RULES GOVERNING PROTECTION MANDATES 2014, c. 1, s. 794. 2166. A protection mandate is a mandate given by a person of full age in anticipation of his incapacity to take care of himself or to administer his property; it is made by a notarial act en minute or in the presence of witnesses.
### Chunk 1766

It may not be made jointly by two or more persons. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 397 of 556 ### Page 398 The performance of the mandate is conditional upon the occurrence of the incapacity, ascertained by medical and psychosocial assessment reports, and homologation by the court upon application by the mandatary designated in the act. 1991, c. 64, a. 2166; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 795; 2020, c. 11, s. 82. 2166. 1. A mandate may, in particular, state the wishes of the mandator with respect to his care or to his living environment.
### Chunk 1767

However, the wishes expressed with respect to medical care in advance medical directives prevail over any conflicting wishes stated in the mandate. The mandate may also state the mandator’s wish to be periodically subject to medical and psychosocial assessments, and set the time limits within which the mandator will be reassessed. The mandate must indicate the person to whom the mandatary shall render an account and the intervals at which the mandatary shall do so, which may not exceed three years.
### Chunk 1768

If the person to whom the mandatary shall render an account has not been designated or where the person designated to receive the account is unable to act, the court may designate another person to receive it. The Public Curator may be designated to receive the account both by the mandator and by the court. 2020, c. 11, s. 83. 2167. A mandate made in the presence of witnesses is drawn up by the mandator or by a third person. The mandator, in the presence of two witnesses who have no interest in the act and who are able to ascertain his capacity to act, declares the nature of the act but need not disclose its contents.
### Chunk 1769

The mandator signs the act at the end or, if he has already signed it, acknowledges his signature; he may also cause a third person to sign the writing for him in his presence and according to his instructions. The witnesses sign the mandate forthwith in the presence of the mandator. 1991, c. 64, a. 2167; I. N. 20140501. 2167. 1. In the course of homologation proceedings or even before if a request for homologation is imminent and it is necessary to act to prevent serious injury for the mandator, the court may issue any order it considers necessary to ensure the personal protection of the mandator, his representation in the exercise of civil rights or the administration of his property.
### Chunk 1770

An act under which the mandator has already charged the administration of his property to another person continues to produce its effects notwithstanding the proceedings, unless the act is revoked by the court for a serious reason. 2002, c. 19, s. 9; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2167. 2. Every decision relating to the homologation or performance of a protection mandate shall be made in the interest of the mandator, respect his rights and safeguard his autonomy, taking into account his wishes and preferences.
### Chunk 1771

The mandator shall, so far as possible and without delay, be informed of the decision. 2020, c. 11, s. 84. 2167. 3. To ensure the moral and material wellbeing of the mandator, the mandatary takes into account his condition, his needs and his faculties as well as the other circumstances of his situation. So far as possible, the mandatary shall maintain a personal relationship with the mandator, involve him in the decisions made in his regard and keep him informed of those decisions.
### Chunk 1772

2020, c. 11, s. 84. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 398 of 556 ### Page 399 2167. 4. The mandatary shall, within 60 days after the mandate is homologated, make an inventory of the property to be administered and transmit a copy of it to the person designated to receive the account. The rules for administration of the property of others set out in articles 1326 to 1329 apply to the inventory, subject to any stipulations regarding it in the mandate.
### Chunk 1773

2020, c. 11, s. 84. 2167. 5. A mandatary who continues the administration of another mandatary after the rendering of account is exempt from making an inventory, subject to the stipulations in the mandate. 2020, c. 11, s. 84. 2168. Where the scope of the mandate is unclear, the mandatary interprets it according to the rules that apply to tutorship to persons of full age. If as a result any notice, consent or authorization is required pursuant to the rules with respect to the administration of the property of others, the mandatary obtains it from the Public Curator or from the court.
### Chunk 1774

1991, c. 64, a. 2168; I. N. 20140501. 2169. Where the mandate does not fully ensure care of the person or administration of his property, tutorship to a person of full age may be instituted to complete it; the mandatary then continues to perform the mandate and reports, on request and at least once each year, to the tutor. At the end of the mandate, he renders an account to the tutor. The mandatary is bound by such obligations only with respect to the tutor to the person. If the protection of the person is assumed by the mandatary himself, the tutor to property is bound by the same obligations towards the mandatary.
### Chunk 1775

1991, c. 64, a. 2169; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 85. 2170. Acts performed before the homologation of the mandate may be annulled or the resulting obligations may be reduced, on the mere proof that the mandator’s incapacity was notorious or known to the other contracting party at the time that the acts were entered into. Acts performed alone by the mandator after the homologation of the mandate that are incompatible with its stipulations may not be annulled or the resulting obligations reduced, unless he suffers injury therefrom.
### Chunk 1776

1991, c. 64, a. 2170; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 11, s. 86. 2171. Unless otherwise stipulated in the mandate, the mandatary is authorized to perform, to his benefit, the obligations of the mandator provided in articles 2150 to 2152 and 2154. 1991, c. 64, a. 2171. 2172. The mandate ceases to have effect when the court ascertains that the mandator has again become capable; the mandator may then revoke his mandate if he considers it appropriate to do so. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1777

2172. 2173. If the director general of the health and social services establishment which provides care or services to the mandator becomes aware that the mandator has again become capable, he shall attest to such capacity in a report filed in the office of the court. The report includes the medical and psychosocial assessments. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 399 of 556 ### Page 400 The mandator or the mandatary may also request medical and psychosocial assessments to assess the capacity of the mandator.
### Chunk 1778

If the assessors conclude that the mandator has again become capable, they shall send a copy of their assessment reports to the mandator and the mandatary and file a copy in the office of the court. The clerk informs the mandatary, the mandator and the persons qualified to intervene in an application for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age that the report has been filed. If no objection is made within 30 days after the date of the notice, the court is presumed to have found that the mandator has again become capable, and the clerk shall, without delay, transmit a notice of cessation of the effects of the mandate to the mandator, the mandatary and the Public Curator.
### Chunk 1779

1991, c. 64, a. 2173; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 87. 2174. Notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, the mandatary may not renounce his mandate unless he has first seen to his replacement if the mandate provides therefor, or has applied for the institution of tutorship to a person of full age for the mandator. 1991, c. 64, a. 2174; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 238; 2020, c. 11, s. 88. 2174. 1. The replacement mandatary is bound to give notice of his taking office to the Public Curator.
### Chunk 1780

2020, c. 11, s. 89. 2174. 2. The replacement mandatary may, if the mandate is not being faithfully performed or for any other serious reason, apply to the court to have it replace the initial mandatary and order the rendering of an account by the latter. 2020, c. 11, s. 89. DIVISION V TERMINATION OF MANDATE 2175. In addition to the causes of extinction common to obligations, the mandate is terminated by its revocation by the mandator, by renunciation by the mandatary, by the extinction of the power conferred on the mandatary or by the death of either of the parties.
### Chunk 1781

The mandate is also terminated by bankruptcy, except in the case of a protection mandate given by gratuitous title; it may also be terminated, in certain cases, by the institution of tutorship to a person of full age or the homologation of a protection mandate for either of the parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 2175; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2020, c. 11, s. 90. 2176. The mandator may revoke the mandate and compel the mandatary to return to him the power of attorney in order to make a notation thereon of the termination of the mandate.
### Chunk 1782

The mandatary has the right to require that the mandator furnish him with a duplicate of the power of attorney containing the notation. Where the power of attorney is made by notarial act en minute, the mandator makes the notation on a copy and may give notice of the termination of the mandate to the depositary of the act, who is bound to note it on the act and on every copy of it which he issues. Such a notation may be made on the mandate or, if applicable, on a copy of it or in a writing attached to the mandate or copy, directly or by a reference.
### Chunk 1783

1991, c. 64, a. 2176; I. N. 20140501; 2023, c. 23, s. 4. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 400 of 556 ### Page 401 2177. Where the mandator is incapable, any interested person, including the Public Curator, may, if the mandate is not being faithfully performed or for any other serious reason, apply to have the court revoke the mandate, order the rendering of an account by the mandatary and institute tutorship to a person of full age for the mandator.
### Chunk 1784

1991, c. 64, a. 2177; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 91. 2178. The mandatary may renounce the mandate he has accepted by so notifying the mandator. He is thereupon entitled, if the mandate was given by onerous title, to the remuneration he has earned until the day of his renunciation. However, the mandatary is bound to make reparation for injury caused to the mandator by his renunciation, if he renounces without a serious reason and at an inopportune moment. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1785

2178; I. N. 20140501. 2179. The mandator may, for a fixed term or to ensure the performance of a particular obligation, renounce his right to revoke the mandate unilaterally. The mandatary may, in the same manner, undertake not to exercise his right of renunciation. Unilateral revocation or renunciation by, as the case may be, the mandator or the mandatary despite his undertaking terminates the mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2179; 2002, c. 19, s. 10; I. N. 20140501. 2180. The appointment of a new mandatary by the mandator for the same matter is equivalent to revocation of the first mandatary from the day the first mandatary was notified of the new appointment.
### Chunk 1786

1991, c. 64, a. 2180; I. N. 20140501. 2181. A mandator who revokes a mandate remains bound to perform his obligations towards the mandatary; he is also bound to make reparation for injury caused to the mandatary as a result of a revocation made without a serious reason and at an inopportune moment. Where notice of the revocation has been given only to the mandatary, the revocation does not affect a third person who deals with him while unaware of the revocation, without prejudice, however, to the remedy of the mandator against the mandatary.
### Chunk 1787

1991, c. 64, a. 2181; I. N. 20140501. 2182. Upon termination of the mandate, the mandatary is bound to do everything which is a necessary consequence of his acts or which cannot be deferred without risk of loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2182. 2182. 1. In the case of a protection mandate, the mandatary is bound to give notice of the mandator’s death to the Public Curator. 2020, c. 11, s. 92. 2183. Upon the death of the mandatary or tutorship to a person of full age being instituted for him, the liquidator or tutor, if aware of the mandate and able to act, is bound to notify the mandator of the event and, with respect to any matter already begun, to do everything which cannot be deferred without risk of loss.
### Chunk 1788

The same rule applies upon the homologation of a protection mandate for the mandatary. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 401 of 556 ### Page 402 In the case of a protection mandate, the liquidator of the mandatary is bound, in the same circumstances, to give notice of the mandatary’s death to the Public Curator. 1991, c. 64, a. 2183; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 239; 2020, c. 11, s. 93. 2184. Upon termination of the mandate, the mandatary is bound to render an account and hand over to the mandator everything he has received in the performance of his duties, even if what he has received was not due to the mandator.
### Chunk 1789

The mandatary owes interest, computed from the date of default, on sums received that constitute the balance of the account. 1991, c. 64, a. 2184; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2185. A mandatary is entitled to deduct what the mandator owes him by reason of the mandate from the sums he is required to remit. The mandatary may also retain what was entrusted to him by the mandator for the performance of the mandate until payment of the sums due to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2185.
### Chunk 1790

CHAPTER X CONTRACTS OF PARTNERSHIP AND OF ASSOCIATION DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS 2186. A contract of partnership is a contract by which the parties, in a spirit of cooperation, agree to carry on an activity, including the operation of an enterprise, to contribute thereto by combining property, knowledge or activities and to share among themselves any resulting pecuniary profits. A contract of association is a contract by which the parties agree to pursue a common goal other than the making of pecuniary profits to be shared among the members of the association.
### Chunk 1791

1991, c. 64, a. 2186; I. N. 20140501. 2187. The partnership or association is created upon the formation of the contract if no other date is indicated in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2187. 2188. Partnerships are either general partnerships, limited partnerships or undeclared partnerships. They may also be in jointstock form, in which case they are legal persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 2188; I. N. 20140501. 2189. A general or limited partnership is formed under a name that is common to the partners.
### Chunk 1792

It shall file a registration declaration in accordance with the Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (chapter P44. 1); otherwise, it is deemed to be an undeclared partnership, subject to the rights of third persons in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 2189; 2010, c. 7, s. 168. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 402 of 556 ### Page 403 2190. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 2190; 2010, c. 7, s. 169. 2191.

1). 1991, c. 64, a. 2191; 2010, c. 7, s. 170. 2192. A correction that would infringe upon the rights of the partners or of third persons has no effect in their regard unless they consented to it or unless the court, after hearing the persons concerned and, if necessary, amending the proposed updating declaration, ordered that it be filed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2192; 2010, c. 7, s. 170. 2193. The correction is deemed to be part of the registration declaration and to have taken effect simultaneously with it unless a later date is provided in the updating declaration or in the judgment.
### Chunk 1794

1991, c. 64, a. 2193; 2010, c. 7, s. 170. 2194. Any change to the content of the registration declaration of the partnership shall be set forth in an updating declaration in accordance with the Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (chapter P44. 1). 1991, c. 64, a. 2194; 2010, c. 7, s. 171. 2195. Declarations relating to a partnership may be set up against third persons from the time the information they contain is recorded in the enterprise register. They constitute proof of their content in favour of third persons in good faith.
### Chunk 1795

Third persons may refute the statements contained in a declaration, by any means. 1991, c. 64, a. 2195; 2010, c. 7, s. 172; 2010, c. 40, s. 92; I. N. 20140501. 2196. If the registration declaration of the partnership is incomplete, inaccurate or irregular or, despite a change having occurred in the partnership, no updating declaration has been filed, the partners are liable to third persons for the resulting obligations of the partnership; however, special partners who are not otherwise liable for the obligations of the partnership do not incur that liablity.
### Chunk 1796

1991, c. 64, a. 2196; 2010, c. 7, s. 173; I. N. 20140501. 2197. A general or limited partnership shall, in the course of its activities, indicate its juridical form in its name or after its name. Failing such indication in an act concluded by the partnership, the court, in ruling on the action of a third person in good faith, may decide that the partnership and its partners are liable, with respect to that act, in the same manner as an undeclared partnership and its partners. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1797

64, a. 2197; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION II GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS § 1. — Relations of partners between themselves and with the partnership 2198. A partner is a debtor to the partnership for everything he promises to contribute to it. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 403 of 556 ### Page 404 Where a person promises to contribute a sum of money and fails to do so, he is liable for interest from the day his contribution ought to have been made, subject to any additional damages which may be claimed from him.
### Chunk 1798

1991, c. 64, a. 2198; I. N. 20140501. 2199. A contribution of property is made by transferring rights of ownership or of enjoyment and by placing the property at the disposal of the partnership. In his relations with the partnership, the person who contributes property is warrantor therefor, in the same manner as a seller towards a buyer, where the contribution consists in the ownership of property; he is warrantor therefor, in the same manner as a lessor towards a lessee, where the contribution consists in the enjoyment of property.
### Chunk 1799

In the case of property that would normally need to be renewed during the term of the partnership, a contribution consisting in enjoyment transfers ownership of the property to the partnership, subject to the obligation for it to return property of the same quantity, quality and value. 1991, c. 64, a. 2199; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2200. A contribution consisting of knowledge or activities is owed continuously so long as the partner who undertook to make such a contribution is a member of the partnership; the partner is liable to the partnership for any profit he realizes from the contribution.
### Chunk 1800

1991, c. 64, a. 2200; I. N. 20140501. 2201. Participation in the profits of a partnership entails the obligation to share in the losses. 1991, c. 64, a. 2201. 2202. The share of each partner in the assets, profits and losses is equal if it is not determined by the contract. If the contract determines only each partner’s share of the assets, profits or losses, that determination is presumed to be made for all three cases. 1991, c. 64, a. 2202; I. N. 20140501. 2203.
### Chunk 1801

Any stipulation whereby a partner is excluded from participation in the profits is without effect. Any stipulation whereby a partner is exempt from the obligation to share in the losses may not be set up against third persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 2203. 2204. A partner may not compete with the partnership on his own account or on behalf of a third person, or take part in an activity which deprives the partnership of the property, knowledge or activity he is bound to contribute to it; any profits arising therefrom belong to the partnership, without prejudice to the remedies it may pursue.
### Chunk 1802

1991, c. 64, a. 2204; I. N. 20140501. 2205. A partner is entitled, if he was in good faith, to recover the amount of the disbursements he made on behalf of the partnership and to be indemnified for the obligations he contracted and for the losses he suffered in acting for the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2205; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 404 of 556 ### Page 405 2206. Where one of the partners is, on his own account, the creditor of a person who is also a debtor of the partnership, and the debts are equally due, the amounts he receives from the debtor shall be charged to both claims in proportion to their respective amounts.
### Chunk 1803

1991, c. 64, a. 2206; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2207. Where a partner has received his full share of a claim due to the partnership, and the debtor becomes insolvent, the partner is bound to remit to the partnership what he has received, even though he may have given an acquittance for his share. 1991, c. 64, a. 2207; I. N. 20140501. 2208. Each partner may use the property of the partnership, provided he uses it in the interest of the partnership, according to the property’s destination, and in such a way as not to prevent the other partners from using it as they are entitled.
### Chunk 1804

Each partner may also bind the partnership in the course of its activities, but the partners may oppose dealings before they are entered into or restrict the right of a partner to bind the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2208; I. N. 20140501. 2209. A partner may, without the consent of the other partners, become a partner with a third person with respect to his share in the partnership, but he may not make him a member of the partnership without their consent. Within 60 days after becoming aware that a person who is not a member of the partnership has acquired the share of a partner by onerous title, any partner may exclude the person from the partnership by reimbursing him for the price of the share and the expenses he has paid.
### Chunk 1805

That right may only be exercised within one year from the acquisition of the share. 1991, c. 64, a. 2209; I. N. 20140501. 2210. Where a partner transfers his share in the partnership to a partner or to the partnership or where the partnership redeems it, the value of the share, if the parties fail to agree on it, is determined by an expert designated by the parties or, failing that, by the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 2210. 2211. The share of a partner in the assets or profits of the partnership may be charged with a hypothec.
### Chunk 1806

However, the share of a partner in the assets may only be hypothecated with the consent of the other partners or if so provided in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2211; I. N. 20140501. 2212. The partners may enter into such agreements between themselves as they consider appropriate with regard to their respective powers in the management of the affairs of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2212. 2213. The partners may appoint one or more fellow partners or even a third person to manage the affairs of the partnership.
### Chunk 1807

Notwithstanding the objection of the partners, the manager may perform any act within his management powers, provided he does not act fraudulently. As long as the partnership lasts, those powers may not be revoked without a serious reason, except where they were conferred by an act subsequent to the contract of partnership, in which case they may be revoked in the same manner as a simple mandate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2213; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 405 of 556 ### Page 406 2214.
### Chunk 1808

Where several persons are charged with the management without it being divided among them and without any stipulation preventing one from acting without the others, each of them may act separately; where there is such a stipulation, however, none of them may act without the others, even where it is impossible for the others to join in the act. 1991, c. 64, a. 2214; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 240. 2215. Failing any stipulation as to the mode of management, the partners are deemed to have conferred the power to manage the affairs of the partnership on one another.
### Chunk 1809

Any act performed by a partner with respect to the common activities binds the other partners, without prejudice to their right to object, jointly or separately, to the act before it is performed. In addition, each partner may compel his partners to incur any expenses necessary to preserve the common property, but a partner may not change the condition of that property without the consent of the others, regardless of how advantageous such change may be. 1991, c. 64, a. 2215; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1810

2216. Every partner has the right to participate in collective decisions, and the contract of partnership may not prevent him from exercising that right. Unless otherwise stipulated in the contract, collective decisions are taken by a majority vote of the partners, regardless of the value of their interests in the partnership, but collective decisions to amend the contract of partnership are taken by a unanimous vote. 1991, c. 64, a. 2216; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c.
### Chunk 1811

4, s. 241. 2217. A partner without powers of management may not alienate or otherwise dispose of common property, subject to the rights of third persons in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 2217. 2218. Notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, any partner, even though he is excluded from management, has the right to inform himself as to the state of the affairs of the partnership and consult its books and records. In exercising this right, the partner is bound not to unduly hinder the operations of the partnership nor to prevent the other partners from exercising the same right.
### Chunk 1812

1991, c. 64, a. 2218; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 2. — Relations of the partnership and the partners with third persons 2219. Each partner is a mandatary of the partnership with respect to third persons in good faith and binds the partnership for every act concluded in its name in the ordinary course of its activities. No stipulation to the contrary may be set up against third persons in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 2219; I. N. 20140501. 2220. An obligation contracted by a partner in his own name binds the partnership when it comes within the scope of the activities of the partnership or when its subject is property for use by the partnership.
### Chunk 1813

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 406 of 556 ### Page 407 A third person may, however, cumulate the defences which may be set up against the partner and the partnership and plead that he would not have entered into the contract if he had known that the partner was acting on behalf of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2220; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2221. With respect to third persons, the partners are jointly liable for the obligations contracted by the partnership but they are solidarily liable if the obligations have been contracted for the service or operation of an enterprise of the partnership.
### Chunk 1814

The creditors may bring an action against a partner for payment only after they have discussed the property of the partnership; even then, the property of the partner is applied to the payment of the creditors of the partnership only after his own creditors have been paid. 1991, c. 64, a. 2221; I. N. 20140501. 2222. A person who gives reason to believe that he is a partner, even though he is not, may be held liable as a partner to third persons in good faith acting in that belief.
### Chunk 1815

The partnership is, however, liable to third persons only if it gave reason to believe that such a person was a partner and it failed to take measures to prevent the error on their part in circumstances in which it was foreseeable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2222; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2223. Silent partners are liable to third persons for the same obligations as declared partners. 1991, c. 64, a. 2223; I. N. 20140501. 2224. A partnership may not make a public offering of securities or issue negotiable instruments, on pain of nullity of the contracts entered into or of the securities or instruments issued and on pain of the obligation to make reparation for any injury the partnership causes to third persons in good faith.
### Chunk 1816

In such a case, the partners are solidarily liable for the obligations of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2224; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2225. A partnership may sue and be sued under the name it declares. 1991, c. 64, a. 2225; 2016, c. 4, s. 242. § 3. — Loss of the quality of partner 2226. A partner ceases to be a member of the partnership by the transfer or redemption of his share, by his death, by tutorship to a person of full age being instituted or a protection mandate homologated for him, by becoming bankrupt, or by the exercise of his right of withdrawal; he also ceases to be a member by his own will, by his expulsion or by a judgment authorizing his withdrawal or ordering the seizure of his share.
### Chunk 1817

1991, c. 64, a. 2226; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 11, s. 94. 2227. A partner who ceases to be a member of the partnership otherwise than by the transfer or seizure of his share is entitled to receive the value his share had when he ceased to be a partner, and the other partners are bound to pay him that value as soon as it is determined, with interest from the day on which his membership ceased. Failing stipulations in the contract of partnership or failing agreement among the interested persons as to the value of the share, the value is determined by an expert designated by the interested persons or, failing CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 407 of 556 ### Page 408 that, by the court.
### Chunk 1818

The expert or the court may, however, defer the assessment of contingent assets or liabilities. 1991, c. 64, a. 2227; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2228. A partner of a partnership constituted for a term that is not fixed or whose contract of partnership reserves the right of withdrawal may withdraw from the partnership by giving it notice of his withdrawal in good faith and not at an inopportune moment. A partner of a partnership constituted for a fixed term may withdraw only with the agreement of a majority of the other partners, unless the contract of partnership stipulates otherwise.
### Chunk 1819

1991, c. 64, a. 2228; I. N. 20140501. 2229. The partners may, by majority vote, agree on the expulsion of a partner who fails to perform his obligations or hinders the carrying on of the activities of the partnership. In the same circumstances, a partner may apply to the court for authorization to withdraw from the partnership; the application is granted unless the court considers it more appropriate to order the expulsion of the partner at fault. 1991, c. 64, a. 2229; I. N.
### Chunk 1820

20140501. § 4. — Dissolution and liquidation of the partnership 2230. A partnership is dissolved for the causes of dissolution provided for in the contract, by the achievement of its object or the impossibility of achieving it, or by consent of all the partners. It may also be dissolved by the court for a legitimate cause. The partnership is then liquidated. 1991, c. 64, a. 2230; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2231. A partnership constituted for a specified term may be continued with the consent of all the partners.
### Chunk 1821

1991, c. 64, a. 2231; I. N. 20140501. 2232. The uniting of all the shares in the hands of a single partner does not entail dissolution of the partnership, provided at least one other partner joins the partnership within 120 days. 1991, c. 64, a. 2232. 2233. The powers of the partners to act on behalf of the partnership cease upon the dissolution of the partnership, except for acts which are a necessary consequence of dealings already begun. However, anything done in the ordinary course of the activities of the partnership by a partner unaware of the dissolution of the partnership and acting in good faith binds the partnership and the other partners as if the partnership were still in existence.
### Chunk 1822

1991, c. 64, a. 2233; I. N. 20140501. 2234. Dissolution of the partnership does not affect the rights of third persons in good faith who subsequently enter into a contract with a partner or a mandatary acting on behalf of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2234. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 408 of 556 ### Page 409 2235. Liquidation of the partnership is subject to the rules provided in articles 358 to 364 of the Book on Persons, adapted as required.
### Chunk 1823

The notices required by those rules shall be filed in accordance with the Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (chapter P44. 1). 1991, c. 64, a. 2235; 2010, c. 7, s. 174. DIVISION III LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 2236. A limited partnership consists of one or more general partners who are the sole persons authorized to administer and bind the partnership, and of one or more special partners who are bound to contribute to the common stock of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1824

2236; I. N. 20140501. 2237. A limited partnership may make a public offering of securities to establish or increase the common stock, and may issue negotiable instruments. A third person who undertakes to contribute becomes a special partner of the partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2237; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2238. General partners have the powers, rights and obligations of the partners of a general partnership but they are bound to render an account of their administration to the special partners.
### Chunk 1825

The general partners are bound by the same obligations towards the special partners as those binding an administrator charged with full administration of the property of others towards the beneficiary of the administration. Clauses restricting the powers of the general partners may not be set up against third persons in good faith. 1991, c. 64, a. 2238. 2239. The general partners keep a register at the place of the principal establishment of the partnership, containing the name and domicile of each of the special partners and all the information concerning their contributions to the common stock.
### Chunk 1826

1991, c. 64, a. 2239; I. N. 20140501. 2240. The contribution of a special partner, where it consists of a sum of money or of any other property, is furnished at the time of establishment of the common stock or at any other time as an additional contribution to the common stock. The special partner assumes the risk of loss of the agreed contribution by superior force until it is delivered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2240. 2241. As long as the partnership lasts, a special partner may not withdraw in any manner any part of his contribution in property to the common stock, unless he obtains the consent of a majority of the other partners and the property remaining after the withdrawal is sufficient to discharge the debts of the partnership.
### Chunk 1827

1991, c. 64, a. 2241; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2242. A special partner is entitled to receive his share of the profits, but if the payment of the profits reduces the common stock, every special partner who receives them is bound to remit such sum as is necessary to cover his share of the deficit, with interest. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 409 of 556 ### Page 410 In the case of a partnership whose capital includes property that is consumed by the partnership’s use of it, the special partner may receive his share of the profits only if the property remaining after the payment is sufficient to discharge the debts of the partnership.
### Chunk 1828

1991, c. 64, a. 2242; I. N. 20140501. 2243. The share of a special partner in the common stock of the partnership is transferable. With respect to third persons, the transferor remains liable for the obligations which may result from his participation in the partnership while he was still a special partner. 1991, c. 64, a. 2243; I. N. 20140501. 2244. A special partner may only give advisory opinions regarding the management of the partnership. A special partner may not negotiate any business on behalf of the partnership or act as mandatary or agent for the partnership or allow his name to be used in any act of the partnership; should he do so, he is liable in the same manner as a general partner for the obligations of the partnership resulting from such acts and, according to the importance or number of such acts, he may be liable in the same manner as a general partner for all the obligations of the partnership.
### Chunk 1829

1991, c. 64, a. 2244; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2245. Where the general partners can no longer act, the special partners may perform any act of simple administration required for the management of the partnership. If the general partners are not replaced within 120 days, the partnership is dissolved. 1991, c. 64, a. 2245. 2246. Where the property of the partnership is insufficient, the general partners are solidarily liable to third persons for the debts of the partnership; a special partner is liable for the debts up to the agreed amount of his contribution, notwithstanding any transfer of his share in the common stock.
### Chunk 1830

Any stipulation whereby a special partner is bound to be surety for or assume the debts of the partnership beyond the agreed amount of his contribution is without effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 2246; I. N. 20140501. 2247. A special partner whose name appears in the firm name of the partnership is liable for the obligations of the partnership in the same manner as a general partner, unless his quality of special partner is clearly indicated. 1991, c. 64, a. 2247. 2248. Where the property of the partnership is insufficient, a special partner may not, in that quality, claim as a creditor until the other creditors of the partnership are satisfied.
### Chunk 1831

1991, c. 64, a. 2248. 2249. In all other respects, the rules governing general partnerships, adapted as required, apply to limited partnerships. 1991, c. 64, a. 2249. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 410 of 556 ### Page 411 DIVISION IV UNDECLARED PARTNERSHIPS § 1. — Establishment of an undeclared partnership 2250. The contract by which an undeclared partnership is constituted may be written or verbal. It may also arise as a result of facts clearly indicating the intention to form an undeclared partnership.
### Chunk 1832

Mere indivision of property existing between several persons does not create a presumption of their intention to form an undeclared partnership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2250; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 2. — Relations of the partners between themselves 2251. The partners agree upon the object, operation, management and other terms and conditions of the undeclared partnership. Failing any special agreement, the relations of the partners between themselves are subject to the provisions governing the relations of general partners between themselves and with the partnership, adapted as required.
### Chunk 1833

1991, c. 64, a. 2251; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 3. — Relations of the partners with third persons 2252. With respect to third persons, each partner remains the owner of the property he contributes to the undeclared partnership. Property that was undivided before the contributions of the partners were combined or that is undivided by agreement of the partners, or any property acquired using undivided sums during the term of the contract of partnership, is undivided property as between the partners.
### Chunk 1834

1991, c. 64, a. 2252; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2253. Each partner contracts in his own name and is alone liable to third persons. However, where the partners act in the quality of partners to the knowledge of third persons, each partner is liable to the latter for the obligations resulting from acts performed in that quality by any of the other partners. 1991, c. 64, a. 2253; I. N. 20140501. 2254. The partners are not solidarily liable for debts contracted in the course of carrying on their activity unless the debts have been contracted for the service or operation of a common enterprise; they are liable to the creditor, each for an equal share, even if their shares in the undeclared partnership are unequal.
### Chunk 1835

1991, c. 64, a. 2254; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 243. 2255. No stipulation limiting the extent of the partners’ obligation towards third persons may be set up against the latter. 1991, c. 64, a. 2255; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 411 of 556 ### Page 412 2256. The partners may exercise all the rights arising from contracts entered into by another partner, but the third person is bound only towards the partner with whom he contracted, unless that partner declared his quality.
### Chunk 1836

1991, c. 64, a. 2256; I. N. 20140501. 2257. Any action which may be brought against all the partners may also be brought against one or more of them, as partners of other persons, without naming the other persons in the action. Where judgment is rendered against the partner or partners sued, all the other partners may be sued jointly or separately on the same cause of action. Where the action is based on an obligation set forth in a writing naming all the partners bound thereby, all of them must be parties to the action for the judgment to be set up against them.
### Chunk 1837

1991, c. 64, a. 2257; I. N. 20140501. § 4. — Termination of the contract of undeclared partnership 2258. A contract of undeclared partnership is terminated by resiliation with the consent of all the partners, by the expiry of its term, by the fulfilment of the condition attached to the contract, or by the achievement of the object of the contract or the impossibility of achieving it.

It may be stipulated that, in the event of the death of one of the partners, the undeclared partnership will continue with his legal representatives or among the surviving partners. In the latter case, the representatives of the deceased partner are entitled to the partition of the property of the undeclared partnership only as it existed at the time of death of the partner. They may not claim benefits arising from subsequent dealings unless the dealings are a necessary consequence of those carried out before the death.
### Chunk 1839

1991, c. 64, a. 2259; I. N. 20140501. 2260. Where a contract of undeclared partnership is made for a term that is not fixed or where it reserves a right of withdrawal, it may be terminated at any time by mere notice given by one of the partners to the other partners, provided it is given in good faith and not at an inopportune moment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2260; I.

A partner is entitled to restitution of the property corresponding to the share he owns, and to demand the apportionment in kind or by equivalence of the undivided property he owns in the undeclared partnership, upon termination of the contract. Failing agreement as to the value of the share, the liquidator or, failing him, the court determines it. The liquidator or the court may, however, defer assessment of contingent assets or liabilities. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1843

2265; I. N. 20140501. 2266. The liquidator has the seisin of the common property and acts as an administrator of the property of others charged with full administration.

### Chunk 1847

In exercising this right, the member is bound not to unduly hinder the activities of the association nor to prevent the other members from exercising the same right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2273; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2274.

After payment of the debts, the remaining property devolves in accordance with the rules respecting the contract of association or, failing special rules, it is shared equally among the members. However, any property derived from contributions of third persons devolves, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, to an association, legal person or trust sharing objectives similar to those of the association; if such devolution is not possible, the property devolves to the State and is administered by the Minister of Revenue as property without an owner or, if it is of little value, it is shared equally among the members.

1991, c. 64, a. 2339. 2340. Suretyship may be contracted only for a valid obligation. It may be for the fulfilment of an obligation from which the principal debtor may be discharged by invoking his incapacity, provided the surety is aware of this, or the fulfilment of a purely natural obligation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2340. 2341. Suretyship may not exceed what is owed by the debtor, or be contracted with more onerous conditions. Suretyship which does not meet that requirement is not null for that reason; it may only be reduced to the extent of the principal obligation.
### Chunk 1883

1991, c. 64, a. 2341; I. N. 20140501. 2342. Suretyship may be contracted for part of the principal obligation only and with less onerous conditions. 1991, c. 64, a. 2342; I. N. 20140501. 2343. Suretyship may not be extended beyond the limits for which it was contracted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2343; I. N. 20151101. 2344. Suretyship extends to all the accessories of the principal obligation, even to the costs of the first demand and to all costs subsequent to notice of it given to the surety.
### Chunk 1884

1991, c. 64, a. 2344; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 249. DIVISION II EFFECTS OF SURETYSHIP § 1. — Effects between the creditor and the surety 2345. At the request of the surety, the creditor is bound to provide him with any useful information as to the content and the terms and conditions of the principal obligation and as to the stage reached in its performance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2345; I. N. 20140501. 2346. The surety is bound to fulfil the obligation of the debtor only if the debtor fails to perform it.
### Chunk 1885

1991, c. 64, a. 2346. 2347. A conventional or legal surety enjoys the benefit of discussion unless he renounces it expressly. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 422 of 556 ### Page 423 A person who is surety of a judicial surety may not demand the discussion of the principal debtor nor of the surety. 1991, c. 64, a. 2347. 2348. A surety who avails himself of the benefit of discussion shall invoke it in the action against him, indicate to the creditor the seizable property of the principal debtor, and advance to the creditor the sums required for the costs of discussion.
### Chunk 1886

Where the creditor neglects to carry out the discussion, he is liable to the surety, up to the value of the property indicated, for insolvency of the principal debtor occurring after the surety has indicated the seizable property of the principal debtor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2348; I. N. 20140501. 2349. Where several persons become sureties of the same debtor for the same debt, each of them is liable for the whole debt but may invoke the benefit of division if he has not renounced it expressly in advance.
### Chunk 1887

Each surety who avails himself of the benefit of division may require the creditor to divide his action and to reduce it to the amount of the share and portion of each surety. 1991, c. 64, a. 2349. 2350. If, at the time division was obtained by one of the sureties, some of them were insolvent, that surety is proportionately liable for their insolvency, but he may not be made liable for insolvencies occurring after the division. 1991, c. 64, a. 2350. 2351. Where the creditor has himself voluntarily divided his action, he may not call the division into question although, even prior to the time of the division, some of the sureties were insolvent.
### Chunk 1888

1991, c. 64, a. 2351; I. N. 20140501. 2352. Where the surety binds himself with the principal debtor as solidary surety or solidary codebtor, he may no longer invoke the benefits of discussion and division; the effects of his undertaking are governed by the rules established with respect to solidary debts so far as they are consistent with the nature of the suretyship. 1991, c. 64, a. 2352. 2353. A surety, whether or not he is a solidary surety, may set up against the creditor all the defences of the principal debtor, except those which are purely personal to the principal debtor or that are excluded by the terms of his undertaking.
### Chunk 1889

1991, c. 64, a. 2353. 2354. The surety is not discharged by mere prorogation of the term granted by the creditor to the principal debtor; in the same way, forfeiture of the term by the principal debtor produces its effects with respect to the surety. 1991, c. 64, a. 2354; I. N. 20140501. 2355. A surety may not renounce in advance the right to be provided with information or the benefit of subrogation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2355. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 423 of 556 ### Page 424 § 2.
### Chunk 1890

— Effects between the debtor and the surety 2356. A surety who has bound himself with the consent of the debtor may claim from him what he has paid in capital, interest and costs, in addition to damages for any injury he has suffered by reason of the suretyship; he may also charge interest on any sum he has had to pay to the creditor, even if the principal debt was not producing interest. A surety who has bound himself without the consent of the debtor may only recover from him what the debtor would have been bound to pay, including damages, if there had been no suretyship; however, costs subsequent to notice of the payment are payable by the debtor.
### Chunk 1891

1991, c. 64, a. 2356; I. N. 20140501. 2357. Where the principal debtor has been discharged from his obligation by invoking his incapacity, the surety has, to the extent of the enrichment retained by the debtor, a remedy for reimbursement against him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2357; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 250. 2358. A surety who paid a debt has no remedy against the principal debtor who paid it subsequently, if he failed to inform the debtor of the payment. A surety who paid without informing the principal debtor has no remedy against him if, at the time of the payment, the debtor had defences that could have enabled him to have the debt declared extinguished.
### Chunk 1892

In these circumstances, the surety has a remedy only for the sum the debtor could have been required to pay, to the extent that the debtor could set up other defences against the creditor to cause the debt to be reduced. In all cases the surety retains his right of action for recovery against the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2358; I. N. 20140501. 2359. A surety who has bound himself with the consent of the debtor may take action against him, even before paying, if he is sued for payment or the debtor is insolvent, or if the debtor has bound himself to effect his acquittance within a certain time.
### Chunk 1893

The same rule applies where the debt becomes payable by the expiry of its term, disregarding any extension granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the surety, or where, by reason of losses incurred by the debtor or of any fault committed by the debtor, the surety is at appreciably higher risk than at the time he bound himself. 1991, c. 64, a. 2359. § 3. — Effects between sureties 2360. Where several persons have become sureties of the same debtor for the same debt, the surety who has paid the debt has in addition to the action in subrogation, a personal right of action against the other sureties, each for his share and portion.
### Chunk 1894

The personal right of action may only be exercised where the surety has paid in one of the cases in which he could take action against the debtor before paying. Where one of the sureties is insolvent, his insolvency is apportioned by contribution among the other sureties, including the surety who made the payment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2360. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 424 of 556 ### Page 425 DIVISION III TERMINATION OF SURETYSHIP 2361. Notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, the death of the surety terminates the suretyship.
### Chunk 1895

1991, c. 64, a. 2361; 2016, c. 4, s. 251. 2362. Where suretyship is contracted with a view to covering future or indeterminate debts, or for an indeterminate period, the surety may terminate it after three years, so long as the debt has not become due, by giving prior and sufficient notice to the debtor, the creditor and the other sureties. This rule does not apply in the case of a judicial suretyship. 1991, c. 64, a. 2362; I. N. 20140501. 2363. Suretyship attached to the performance of special duties is terminated upon cessation of the duties.
### Chunk 1896

1991, c. 64, a. 2363; I. N. 20140501. 2364. Upon termination of the suretyship, the surety remains liable for debts existing at that time, even if those debts are subject to a condition or a term. 1991, c. 64, a. 2364. 2365. Where, as a result of an act or omission of the creditor, the surety can no longer be usefully subrogated to his rights, the surety is discharged to the extent of the injury he suffers thereby. 1991, c. 64, a. 2365; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s.
### Chunk 1897

252. 2366. Where a creditor voluntarily accepts property in payment of the principal debt, the surety is discharged even if the creditor is subsequently evicted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2366; 2016, c. 4, s. 253. CHAPTER XIV ANNUITIES DIVISION I NATURE OF THE CONTRACT AND SCOPE OF THE RULES GOVERNING IT 2367. A contract for the constitution of an annuity is a contract by which a person, the debtor, undertakes, by gratuitous title or in exchange for the alienation of capital for his benefit, to make periodic payments to another person, the annuitant, for a certain time.
### Chunk 1898

The capital may consist of immovable or movable property; if it is a sum of money, it may be paid all at once or in instalments. 1991, c. 64, a. 2367; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 254. 2368. Where the debtor undertakes to pay the annuity in return for the transfer, for his benefit, of ownership of an immovable, the contract is called alienation for rent and it is principally governed by the rules that apply to contracts of sale, to which it is similar. 1991, c. 64, a. 2368; I.
### Chunk 1899

N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 425 of 556 ### Page 426 2369. An annuity may be constituted for the benefit of a person other than the person who furnishes the capital. In such a case, the contract is not subject to the forms required for gifts even though the annuity so constituted is received by gratuitous title by the annuitant. 1991, c. 64, a. 2369; I. N. 20140501. 2370. An annuity may be constituted by contract, will, judgment or law.
### Chunk 1900

The rules of this chapter, adapted as required, apply to such annuities. 1991, c. 64, a. 2370. DIVISION II SCOPE OF THE CONTRACT 2371. An annuity may be either a life annuity or a fixed term annuity. A life annuity is an annuity payable for a duration limited to the lifetime of one or several persons. A fixed term annuity is an annuity payable for a duration determined otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 2371; I. N. 20140501. 2372. A life annuity may be set up for the lifetime of the person who constitutes it or receives it or for the lifetime of a third person who has no right to enjoyment of the annuity.
### Chunk 1901

It may be stipulated, however, that the payment of the annuity will continue beyond the death of the person upon whose life the duration of payment of the annuity was determined, for the benefit, as the case may be, of a determinate person or of the heirs of the annuitant. 1991, c. 64, a. 2372; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 255. 2373. A life annuity set up for the lifetime of a person who is dead on the day the debtor is to begin paying the annuity or who dies within the following 30 days is without effect.
### Chunk 1902

Similarly, a life annuity set up for the lifetime of a person who does not exist yet on the day on which the debtor is to begin paying the annuity is without effect, unless the person was conceived at that time and is born alive and viable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2373; I. N. 20140501. 2374. Where a life annuity is set up for the lifetime of several persons successively, it has effect only if the first of those persons exists on the day the debtor is to begin paying the annuity or if he is conceived at that time and is born alive and viable.
### Chunk 1903

It terminates where the persons concerned are dead or are not born alive and viable, but not later than 100 years after it is constituted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2374. 2375. A nonreturnable loan is presumed to constitute a life annuity for the benefit and for the lifetime of the lender. 1991, c. 64, a. 2375. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 426 of 556 ### Page 427 2376. The duration of payment of any annuity, whether or not it is a life annuity, is in all cases limited or reduced to 100 years after the annuity is constituted even if the contract provides for a longer duration or constitutes a successive annuity.
### Chunk 1904

1991, c. 64, a. 2376. DIVISION III CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE CONTRACT 2377. A stipulation may be made to the effect that the annuity is unseizable and inalienable only if the annuitant receives it by gratuitous title; even in such a case, the stipulation has effect only up to the amount of the annuity necessary to the annuitant as support. 1991, c. 64, a. 2377; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2378. Any capital accumulated for the payment of the annuity is unseizable where the annuity is payable to the annuitant and to the person substituted for him, so long as the capital is appropriated to the payment of an annuity.
### Chunk 1905

Only that part of the capital is unseizable, however, which, in the assessment of the seizing creditor, the debtor and the annuitant or, if they disagree, the court, would be necessary, for the duration fixed in the contract, for the payment of an annuity which would meet the requirements of the annuitant for support. 1991, c. 64, a. 2378; I. N. 20140501. 2379. The designation or revocation of an annuitant, other than the person who furnished the capital of the annuity, is governed by the rules that apply to stipulations for another.
### Chunk 1906

However, the designation or revocation of an annuitant, with respect to annuities provided by insurers or pursuant to a retirement plan, is governed by the rules for contracts of insurance that relate to beneficiaries and subrogated policyholders, adapted as required. 1991, c. 64, a. 2379; I. N. 20140501. 2380. A stipulation may be made to the effect that a life annuity, constituted for the benefit of two or more annuitants jointly, continues on the death of one of the annuitants for the lifetimes of those who survive him.
### Chunk 1907

Similarly, a life annuity constituted for the benefit of spouses is presumed, on the death of either spouse, to continue for the lifetime of the surviving spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 2380; I. N. 20140501. 2381. The life annuity is due to the annuitant only in proportion to the number of days lived by the person upon whose life the duration of payment of the annuity was determined, and the annuitant may demand payment of the annuity only if he establishes the existence of the person. However, where it was stipulated that the annuity would be paid in advance, that which was to have been paid vests from the day it was to have been paid.
### Chunk 1908

1991, c. 64, a. 2381; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2382. Payments are made at the end of each payment period, which may not exceed one year; the amount due is computed from the day the debtor is bound to begin paying the annuity. 1991, c. 64, a. 2382. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 427 of 556 ### Page 428 2383. In no case may the debtor free himself from the payment of the annuity by offering to reimburse the capital value of the annuity and renouncing the recovery of the annuity payments made; he is bound to pay the annuity for the whole duration stipulated in the contract.
### Chunk 1909

1991, c. 64, a. 2383. 2384. The debtor of an annuity may appoint an authorized insurer to replace him, by paying that insurer the value of the annuity. Similarly, the owner of an immovable charged as security for the payment of the annuity may substitute the security offered by an authorized insurer for that securing the annuity. The annuitant may not object to the substitution, but he may require that the purchase of the annuity be made with another insurer, or he may contest the determined capital value or the value of the annuity arising therefrom.
### Chunk 1910

1991, c. 64, a. 2384; I. N. 20140501. 2385. The substitution releases the debtor or the owner of the immovable charged as security for the payment of the annuity, upon payment of the required capital; it binds the insurer towards the annuitant and, as the case may be, entails the extinction of the hypothec securing the payment of the annuity. 1991, c. 64, a. 2385. 2386. The nonpayment of the annuity is not a reason which permits the annuitant to demand recovery of the capital alienated for the constitution of the annuity; it only allows him, beyond demanding payment of the amount owing, to seize and sell the property of the debtor and obtain consent to, or require an order for, the use of an amount, from the proceeds of the sale, sufficient to ensure payment of the annuity, or to require that the debtor be replaced by an authorized insurer.
### Chunk 1911

Payment of the capital may be required, however, if the debtor becomes insolvent or bankrupt or decreases, by his act or omission and without the consent of the annuitant, the security he has furnished to secure the payment of the annuity. 1991, c. 64, a. 2386; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 256. 2387. Where the payment of an annuity is secured by a hypothec on property that is to be the subject of a sale under judicial authority, the annuitant may not require that the sale be carried out subject to his annuity but, if his hypothec ranks first, he may require the creditor to furnish him with a surety sufficient to ensure that the annuity continues to be paid.
### Chunk 1912

Failure to furnish a surety entitles the annuitant, according to his rank, to receive the capital value of the annuity on the day of collocation or distribution. 1991, c. 64, a. 2387; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 796. 2388. The capital value of an annuity is always assessed as equal to the amount that would be sufficient to acquire an annuity of equivalent value from an authorized insurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2388; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 428 of 556 ### Page 429 CHAPTER XV INSURANCE DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1.
### Chunk 1913

— Nature of the contract of insurance and classes of insurance 2389. A contract of insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes, for a premium or assessment, to make a payment to the client or a third person if a risk covered by the insurance occurs. Insurance is divided into marine insurance and nonmarine insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2389; I. N. 20140501. 2390. The object of marine insurance is to indemnify the insured against losses incident to marine adventure. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1914

64, a. 2390. 2391. Nonmarine insurance is divided into insurance of persons and damage insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2391. 2392. Insurance of persons covers the life, physical integrity or health of the insured. Insurance of persons is divided into individual insurance and group insurance. Group insurance of persons covers, under a master policy, the participants in a specified group and, in some cases, their families or dependants. 1991, c. 64, a. 2392; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 1915

2393. Life insurance guarantees payment of the agreed amount upon the death of the insured; it may also guarantee payment of the agreed amount during the lifetime of the insured, on his surviving a specified period or on the occurrence of an event related to his existence. Life or fixedterm annuities provided by insurers are assimilated to life insurance but also remain governed by the chapter on Annuities. However, the rules in this chapter that apply to unseizability take precedence. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1916

64, a. 2393; I. N. 20140501. 2394. Clauses of accident or sickness insurance which are accessory to a contract of life insurance and clauses of life insurance which are accessory to a contract of accident or sickness insurance are governed by the rules governing the principal contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2394; 2016, c. 4, s. 257. 2395. Damage insurance protects the insured against the consequences of an event that may adversely affect his patrimony. 1991, c. 64, a. 2395; I.
### Chunk 1917

4, s. 258. 2397. The contract of reinsurance has effect only between the insurer and the reinsurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2397. § 2. — Formation and content of the contract 2398. A contract of insurance is formed upon acceptance by the insurer of the application of the client. 1991, c. 64, a. 2398. 2399. The policy is the document evidencing the existence of the contract of insurance. In addition to the names of the parties to the contract and the names of the persons to whom the insured sums are payable or, if those persons are not determined, a means to identify them, the subject of the insurance shall be set out in the policy, together with the amount of coverage, the nature of the risks insured, the time from which the risks are covered and the term of the coverage as well as the amount and rate of the premiums and the dates on which they are due.
### Chunk 1919

1991, c. 64, a. 2399; I. N. 20151101. 2400. In nonmarine insurance, the insurer is bound to deliver the policy to the client, as well as a copy of any application in writing made by or on behalf of the client. In case of inconsistency between the policy and the application, the latter prevails unless the insurer has indicated in writing to the client, in a separate document, the particulars of the inconsistency. 1991, c. 64, a. 2400; I. N. 20140501. 2401. In group insurance, the insurer issues the group insurance policy to the client and delivers to him the insurance certificates, which the latter shall distribute to the participants.
### Chunk 1920

Participants and beneficiaries may examine and make copies of the policy at the place of business of the client and, in case of inconsistency between the policy and the insurance certificate, they may invoke either one according to their interest. 1991, c. 64, a. 2401; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2402. In nonmarine insurance, any general clause whereby the insurer is released from his obligations if the law is violated is deemed not written, unless the violation is an indictable offence.
### Chunk 1921

Any clause of a policy whereby the insured consents, in case of loss, to effect an assignment of claim to his insurer that would result in granting his insurer more rights than he would have under the rules on subrogation is also deemed not written. 1991, c. 64, a. 2402. 2403. Subject to the special provisions on marine insurance, the insurer may not invoke conditions or representations not stated in writing in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2403; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 430 of 556 ### Page 431 2404.
### Chunk 1922

In insurance of persons, the insurer may invoke only the exclusions or clauses reducing coverage that are clearly indicated under an appropriate heading. 1991, c. 64, a. 2404; I. N. 20140501. 2405. In nonmarine insurance, changes to the contract made by the parties are evidenced by riders attached to the policy. However, any rider stipulating a reduction of the insurer’s liability or an increase in the insured’s obligations, other than an increased premium, has no effect unless the policyholder consents to the change in writing.
### Chunk 1923

Where such a change is made upon renewal of the contract, the insurer shall indicate it clearly to the insured in a separate document from the rider which stipulates it. The change is presumed to be accepted by the insured 30 days after receipt of the document. 1991, c. 64, a. 2405; I. N. 20140501. 2406. The representations of a participant in group insurance may be invoked against him only if the insurer has furnished him with a copy of them. 1991, c. 64, a. 2406. 2407.
### Chunk 1924

A certificate of participation in a mutual association may establish the rights and obligations of the members by reference to the articles of the association, but only the constituting instrument and those bylaws which are specifically indicated in the certificate may be invoked against the members. Every member is entitled to a copy of the articles of the association in force. 1991, c. 64, a. 2407. § 3. — Representations and warranties of the client in nonmarine insurance 2016, c.
### Chunk 1925

4, s. 259. 2408. The client, and the insured if the insurer requires it, is bound to represent all the facts known to him which are likely to materially influence an insurer in the setting of the premium, the appraisal of the risk or the decision to cover it, but he is not bound to represent facts that the insurer knows or is presumed to know because of their notoriety, except in answer to inquiries. 1991, c. 64, a. 2408; I. N. 20140501. 2409. The obligation with respect to representations is deemed properly met if the representations are such as a normally provident insured would make, if they were made without material concealment and if the facts are substantially as represented.
### Chunk 1926

1991, c. 64, a. 2409; I. N. 20140501. 2410. Subject to the provisions on statement of age and risk, any misrepresentation or concealment of the facts by either the client or the insured nullifies the contract at the instance of the insurer, even with respect to losses not connected with the risks so misrepresented or concealed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2410; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2411. In damage insurance, unless the bad faith of the client is established or unless it is established that the insurer would not have covered the risk if he had known the facts, the insurer remains liable to the insured CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 431 of 556 ### Page 432 for such proportion of the indemnity as the premium he collected bears to the premium he should have collected.

1991, c. 64, a. 2411; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2412. A breach of warranty aggravating the risk suspends the coverage. The suspension ceases as soon as the insurer has acquiesced or the insured has remedied the breach. 1991, c. 64, a. 2412; I. N. 20140501. 2413. Where the representations contained in the application for insurance have been entered or suggested by the representative of the insurer or by an insurance broker, proof may be made by testimony that they do not correspond to what was actually represented.
### Chunk 1928

1991, c. 64, a. 2413. § 4. — Special provision 2414. Any clause in a nonmarine insurance contract which grants the client, the insured, the participant, the beneficiary or the policyholder fewer rights than are granted by the provisions of this chapter is null. Any stipulation which derogates from the rules on insurable interest or, in liability insurance, from those protecting the rights of injured third persons is also null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2414. DIVISION II INSURANCE OF PERSONS § 1.
### Chunk 1929

— Content of policy 2415. In addition to the particulars prescribed for policies generally, a policy of insurance of persons shall indicate, where applicable, the name of the insured or a means to identify him, the time limits for payment of premiums, any right to policy dividends, the method and table by which the surrender value is determined and any rights to the surrender value and to policy advances. The conditions of reinstatement, the right to convert the insurance, the terms and conditions of payment of sums due and the period during which benefits are payable shall also be set out in the policy, where applicable.
### Chunk 1930

1991, c. 64, a. 2415; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2416. In an accident or sickness policy, the insurer shall set out, expressly and in clearly legible characters, the nature of the coverage stipulated in it. Where the contract provides coverage against disability, he shall set out in the same manner the terms and conditions of payment of the indemnities and the nature and extent of the disability covered. Failing clear indication as to the nature and extent of the disability covered, the inability to carry on one’s usual occupation constitutes the disability.
### Chunk 1931

1991, c. 64, a. 2416; 2016, c. 4, s. 260. 2417. In accident or sickness insurance, the insurer may not, except in case of fraud, exclude or reduce the coverage by reason of a disease or ailment disclosed in the application except under a clause referring by name to the disease or ailment. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 432 of 556 ### Page 433 Except in the case of fraud, an insurer may not, by a general clause, exclude or limit the coverage by reason of a disease or ailment not disclosed in the application unless the disease or ailment appears within the first two years of the insurance.
### Chunk 1932

1991, c. 64, a. 2417; 2016, c. 4, s. 260. § 2. — Insurable interest 2418. In individual insurance, a contract is null if at the time the contract is made the client has no insurable interest in the life or health of the insured, unless the insured consents in writing. Subject to the same reservation, the assignment of such a contract is null if the assignee does not have the required interest at the time of the assignment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2418. 2419. A person has an insurable interest in his own life and health and in the life and health of his spouse, of his descendants and the descendants of his spouse, or of persons who contribute to his support or education.
### Chunk 1933

He also has an interest in the life and health of his subordinates and staff or of persons in whose life and health he has a pecuniary or moral interest. 1991, c. 64, a. 2419; 2016, c. 4, s. 261. § 3. — Representation of age and risk 2420. Misrepresentation of the age of the insured does not nullify the insurance. In such circumstances, the sum insured is adjusted in such proportion as the premium collected bears to the premium that should have been collected. In accident or sickness insurance, however, the insurer may elect to adjust the premium to make it correspond to the rates applicable for the true age of the insured.
### Chunk 1934

1991, c. 64, a. 2420; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 262. 2421. In life insurance, the insurer may apply to have the contract annulled if, at the time of formation of the contract, the age of the insured exceeds the limits fixed by the insurer’s rates. The insurer may apply only within three years of the making of the contract, during the lifetime of the insured and within 60 days after becoming aware of the error. 1991, c. 64, a. 2421; I. N. 20140501; I.
### Chunk 1935

N. 20151101. 2422. In accident or sickness insurance, the true age is the determining factor in cases where the commencement or termination of the insurance depends on the age of the insured. In life insurance, the true age is also the determining factor for termination of a contract which is to terminate at a specified age, where the misrepresentation as to age is discovered before the death of the insured. 1991, c. 64, a. 2422; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 263. 2423. In group insurance, misrepresentation or concealment by a participant as to age or risk affects only the insurance of the persons who are the subject of the misrepresentation or concealment.
### Chunk 1936

1991, c. 64, a. 2423. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 433 of 556 ### Page 434 2424. In the absence of fraud, misrepresentation or concealment as to risk does not justify the annulment or reduction of insurance which has been in force for two years. However, this rule does not apply in the case of disability insurance if the disability begins during the first two years of the insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2424; I. N. 20140501. § 4. — Effective date of the insurance 1991, c.
### Chunk 1937

64, Sd. 4; I. N. 20140501. 2425. Life insurance takes effect when the application is accepted by the insurer, provided that it is accepted without modification, that the initial premium has been paid, and that there has been no change in the insurability of the risk since the application was signed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2425. 2426. Accident or sickness insurance takes effect upon the delivery of the policy to the client, even if it is delivered by a person other than a representative of the insurer.
### Chunk 1938

A policy issued in accordance with the application and given to a representative of the insurer for unconditional delivery to the client is also validly delivered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2426; 2016, c. 4, s. 264. § 5. — Premiums, advances and reinstatement of the insurance 1991, c. 64, Sd. 5; I. N. 20140501. 2427. In life insurance, the policyholder is entitled to 30 days for the payment of each premium, except the initial premium; the insurance remains in force during the 30 days, but failure to pay the premium within that period terminates the insurance.
### Chunk 1939

The period runs concurrently with any other period granted by the insurer, but it may not be reduced by agreement. 1991, c. 64, a. 2427. 2428. When payment is made by bill of exchange, it is deemed made only if the bill is honoured when first presented. The payment is also deemed made when the bill is not honoured by reason of the death of the person who issued the bill of exchange, subject to payment of the premium. 1991, c. 64, a. 2428. 2429. The premium does not bear interest during the period allowed for payment, except in group insurance.
### Chunk 1940

Where the insurer is entitled to interest on a premium due, the interest may not be at a higher rate than that fixed by the regulations made to that effect by the Government. 1991, c. 64, a. 2429. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 434 of 556 ### Page 435 2430. No accident or sickness insurance contract that is in force may be cancelled for nonpayment of the premium unless 15 day’s prior notice in writing is given to the debtor. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 1941

2430; 2016, c. 4, s. 265. 2431. The insurer is bound to reinstate individual life insurance that has been cancelled for nonpayment of the premium if the policyholder applies to him therefor within two years from the date of the cancellation and establishes that the insured still meets the conditions required to be insured under the cancelled contract. The policyholder is bound in that case to pay the overdue premiums and repay the advances he has obtained on the policy, with interest at a rate not exceeding the rate fixed by the regulations made to that effect by the Government.
### Chunk 1942

However, the insurer is not bound by the first paragraph if the surrender value has been paid or if the policyholder has elected for a reduction or extension of coverage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2431; I. N. 20140501. 2432. Any amount payable for the reinstatement of a contract may be made out of advances receivable on the policy up to the sum stipulated in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2432. 2433. The insurer may require the payment of overdue premiums when settling a claim under a group life insurance contract or an accident or sickness insurance contract.
### Chunk 1943

The insurer may, for any individual insurance contract, deduct the amount of any overdue premium out of the benefits payable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2433; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 266. 2434. Upon the reinstatement of a contract of insurance, the twoyear period during which the insurer may apply to have the contract annulled or the coverage reduced by reason of misrepresentation or concealment relating to the risk, or may have effect given to a clause that excludes coverage in case of the suicide of the insured, runs again.
### Chunk 1944

1991, c. 64, a. 2434; I. N. 20140501. § 6. — Performance of the contract of insurance 2435. The holder of an accident or sickness policy or the beneficiary or insured is bound to give written notice of loss to the insurer within 30 days of becoming aware of it. He shall also, within 90 days, transmit all the information to the insurer that he may reasonably expect as to the circumstances and extent of the loss. The person entitled to the payment is not prevented from receiving it if he proves that it was impossible for him to act within the prescribed time, provided the information is sent to the insurer within one year of the loss.
### Chunk 1945

1991, c. 64, a. 2435; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 267. 2436. The insurer is bound to pay the sums insured and the other benefits provided in the contract, in accordance with its conditions, within 30 days after receipt of the required proof of loss. However, in accident or sickness insurance, the period is 60 days, unless the insurance covers losses of income arising from disability. 1991, c. 64, a. 2436; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 268. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 435 of 556 ### Page 436 2437.
### Chunk 1946

Where the insurance covers losses of income arising from disability and the contract stipulates a waiting period, the 30 day period for payment of the first indemnity runs from the expiry of the waiting period. Subsequent payments are made at intervals of not more than 30 days, provided that proof is furnished to the insurer on request. 1991, c. 64, a. 2437; I. N. 20140501. 2438. The insured shall submit to a medical examination when the insurer is entitled to require it owing to the nature of the disability.
### Chunk 1947

1991, c. 64, a. 2438. 2439. In accident or sickness insurance, where an increase of the occupational risk has lasted for six months or more, the insurer may reduce the indemnity provided under the contract to the sum payable for the new risk according to the premium stipulated in the contract. Where there is a reduction of the occupational risk, the insurer is bound, from receipt of a notice to that effect, to reduce the rate of the premium or to extend the insurance by applying the rate corresponding to the new risk, as the client may elect.
### Chunk 1948

1991, c. 64, a. 2439; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 269. 2440. The heirs of the beneficiary of an insurance contract may require the insurer to make a single lump sum payment to them of any sums payable by instalments. 1991, c. 64, a. 2440. 2441. The insurer may not refuse payment of the sums insured by reason of the suicide of the insured unless he expressly stipulated that coverage would be excluded in such a case and, even then, the stipulation is without effect if the suicide occurs after two years of uninterrupted insurance.
### Chunk 1949

Any change made to a contract to increase the amount of coverage is, as regards the additional amount, subject to the initially stipulated exclusion clause for a period of two years of uninterrupted insurance beginning on the effective date of the increase. 1991, c. 64, a. 2441; 2002, c. 70, s. 156; I. N. 20140501. 2441. 1. (Repealed). 2009, c. 25, s. 48; 2018, c. 23, s. 805. 2442. A contract of insurance for funeral expenses whereby a person undertakes, for a premium paid in a single payment or by instalments, to provide services or goods upon the death of another person, to pay funeral expenses or to set aside a sum of money for that purpose is null.
### Chunk 1950

Only the person who paid the premium or instalments or the Autorité des marchés financiers acting on his behalf may bring an action for the annulment of the contract or recovery of the premium. 1991, c. 64, a. 2442; 2002, c. 45, s. 161; 2004, c. 37, s. 90. 2443. An attempt on the life of the insured by the policyholder entails, by operation of law, cancellation of the insurance and payment of the surrender value. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 436 of 556 ### Page 437 An attempt on the life of the insured by any person other than the policyholder entails forfeiture only with respect to that person’s right to the coverage.
### Chunk 1951

1991, c. 64, a. 2443; I. N. 20140501. 2444. The benefits established in favour of a member of a mutual benefit association, or of his or her married or civil union spouse, ascendants or descendants are unseizable either for debts of the member or for debts of the beneficiaries. 1991, c. 64, a. 2444; 2002, c. 6, s. 55. § 7. — Designation of beneficiaries and subrogated policyholders I. — Conditions of designation 2445. The sum insured may be payable to the policyholder, the participant or a specified beneficiary.
### Chunk 1952

In individual insurance, the holder of a policy on the life of a third person may designate a subrogated policyholder to replace him upon his death; he may also designate several subrogated policyholders and specify the order in which they will succeed to any preceding policyholder. A life insurance policy may not be payable to bearer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2445; I. N. 20140501. 2446. The designation of beneficiaries or of subrogated policyholders is made in the policy or in another writing which may or may not be in the form of a will.
### Chunk 1953

1991, c. 64, a. 2446. 2447. The beneficiary or the subrogated policyholder need not exist at the time of designation or be then expressly determined; it is sufficient that at the time his right becomes exigible he exist or, if he is conceived but not born, that he be born alive and viable and that his quality be recognized. The designation of a beneficiary is presumed made on the condition that the beneficiary exists at the time the proceeds of the insurance become payable; the designation of the subrogated policyholder is presumed made on the condition that the person so designated exists at the death of the preceding policyholder.
### Chunk 1954

1991, c. 64, a. 2447; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2448. Where the insured and the beneficiary die at the same time or in circumstances which make it impossible to determine which of them died first, the insured is, for the purposes of the insurance, deemed to have survived the beneficiary. Where the insured dies intestate, leaving no heir within the degrees of succession, the beneficiary is deemed to have survived the insured. In similar circumstances, the preceding policyholder is deemed to have survived the subrogated policyholder.
### Chunk 1955

1991, c. 64, a. 2448. 2449. A policyholder’s or participant’s designation, in a writing other than a will, of his or her married or civil union spouse as beneficiary is irrevocable, unless otherwise stipulated. The designation of any other person as beneficiary is revocable unless otherwise stipulated in the policy or in a separate writing other than a will. The designation of a person as subrogated policyholder is always revocable. Where revocation is permitted, it may only result from a writing but it need not be express.
### Chunk 1956

1991, c. 64, a. 2449; 2002, c. 6, s. 56; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 437 of 556 ### Page 438 2450. A designation or revocation contained in a will that is null by reason of a defect of form is not null for that sole reason; such a designation or revocation is null, however, if the will is revoked. A designation or revocation made in a will does not avail against another designation or revocation subsequent to the signing of the will.
### Chunk 1957

Nor does it avail against a designation prior to the signing of the will unless the will refers to the insurance policy in question or unless the intention of the testator in that respect is manifest. 1991, c. 64, a. 2450. 2451. Regardless of the terms used, every designation of beneficiaries remains revocable until received by the insurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2451. 2452. Designations and revocations may be set up against the insurer only from the day he receives them; where several irrevocable designations of beneficiaries are made separately and at different times, they are given priority according to their dates of receipt by the insurer.
### Chunk 1958

The insurer is discharged by payment in good faith in accordance with these rules to the last known person entitled to it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2452. II. — Effects of a designation 1991, c. 64, Sd. II; I. N. 20140501. 2453. Beneficiaries and subrogated policyholders are the creditors of the insurer but the insurer may set up against them the causes of nullity or forfeiture that may be invoked against the policyholder or participant. 1991, c. 64, a. 2453. 2454. The policyholder is entitled to the policy dividends and other benefits conferred on him by the contract even if the beneficiary has been designated irrevocably.
### Chunk 1959

Policy dividends and benefits shall be imputed by the insurer to any premium due, so as to keep the insurance in force. In either case, the contract may provide otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 2454; I. N. 20140501. 2455. Sums insured payable to a beneficiary do not form part of the succession of the insured. Similarly, a contract transferred to a subrogated policyholder does not form part of the succession of the preceding policyholder. 1991, c. 64, a. 2455. 2456. Insurance payable to the succession or to the assigns, heirs, liquidators or other legal representatives of a person pursuant to a stipulation in which those terms or similar terms are employed forms part of the succession of that person.
### Chunk 1960

The rules on representation of heirs do not apply with respect to insurance but those on accretion to the benefit of legatees by particular title apply among cobeneficiaries or subrogated copolicyholders. 1991, c. 64, a. 2456; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 438 of 556 ### Page 439 2457. Where the designated beneficiary of the insurance is the married or civil union spouse, descendant or ascendant of the policyholder or of the participant, the rights under the contract are exempt from seizure until the beneficiary receives the sum insured.
### Chunk 1961

1991, c. 64, a. 2457; 2002, c. 6, s. 57. 2458. A stipulation of irrevocability binds the policyholder even if the designated beneficiary has no knowledge of it. As long as the designation remains irrevocable, the rights conferred by the contract on the policyholder, participant or beneficiary are exempt from seizure. 1991, c. 64, a. 2458; I. N. 20140501. 2459. Separation from bed and board does not affect the rights of the spouse, whether a beneficiary or a subrogated policyholder.
### Chunk 1962

However, the court may declare them revocable or lapsed when granting a separation. Divorce or nullity of marriage or the dissolution or nullity of a civil union causes any designation of the spouse as beneficiary or subrogated policyholder to lapse. 1991, c. 64, a. 2459; 2002, c. 6, s. 58; I. N. 20140501. 2460. Even if the beneficiary has been designated irrevocably, the policyholder and the participant may dispose of their rights, subject to the rights of the beneficiary. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1963

64, a. 2460. § 8. — Assignment and hypothecation of a right under a contract of insurance 2461. An assignment of a right under a contract of insurance or a hypothec charging such a right may not be set up against the insurer, the beneficiary or third persons until the insurer receives notice thereof. Where a right under a contract of insurance is subject to several assignments or hypothecs, priority is determined by the date on which the insurer is notified. 1991, c. 64, a. 2461; I.
### Chunk 1964

N. 20140501. 2462. The assignment of insurance confers on the assignee all the rights and obligations of the assignor and entails the revocation of the designation of a revocable beneficiary and of a subrogated policyholder. However, a hypothec charging a right under a contract of insurance confers rights on the hypothecary creditor only to the extent of the balance of the claim, interest and accessories; it entails revocation of the designation of a revocable beneficiary and of a subrogated policyholder only with respect to those amounts.
### Chunk 1965

1991, c. 64, a. 2462; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION III DAMAGE INSURANCE § 1. — Provisions common to property insurance and liability insurance I. — Principle of indemnity 2463. In damage insurance, the insurer is obliged to make reparation for the injury suffered at the time of the loss, but only up to the amount of the coverage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2463; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 439 of 556 ### Page 440 2464.
### Chunk 1966

The insurer is bound to make reparation for the injury resulting from superior force or the fault of the insured, unless an exclusion is expressly and restrictively stipulated in the contract. However, the insurer is never bound to make reparation for the injury resulting from the insured’s intentional fault. Where there is more than one insured, the obligation of coverage remains with respect to those insured who have not committed an intentional fault. Where the insurer covers injury caused by a person for whose acts or omissions the insured is bound to make reparation, the obligation of coverage subsists regardless of the nature or gravity of the fault committed by that person.
### Chunk 1967

1991, c. 64, a. 2464; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 270. 2465. The insurer is not bound to indemnify for injury resulting from shrinkage, diminution or losses sustained by the property arising from an inherent defect in, or the nature of, the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2465; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 271. II. — Increase in risk 2016, c. 4, s. 272. 2466. The insured is bound to promptly notify the insurer of any circumstances that increases the risks stipulated in the policy and that result from events within his control if they are such as to materially influence an insurer in setting the rate of the premium, appraising the risk or deciding to continue to insure it.
### Chunk 1968

If the insured fails to discharge his obligation, the provisions of article 2411 apply, adapted as required. 1991, c. 64, a. 2466; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2467. On being notified of the new circumstances, the insurer may cancel the contract or propose, in writing, a new rate of premium, in which case the insured is bound to accept and to pay the premium at the new rate within 30 days of the proposal, otherwise the policy ceases to be in force. However, if the insurer continues to accept the premiums or pays an indemnity after a loss, he is deemed to have acquiesced in the change notified to him.
### Chunk 1969

1991, c. 64, a. 2467; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 273. 2468. The lack of occupation of a residence does not constitute a change which increases the risk if it does not last more than 30 consecutive days or the insurance covers a secondary residence designated as such. Nor does the admission of tradesmen into the residence to do maintenance or repair work for a period of not more than 30 days constitute a change which increases the risk. 1991, c. 64, a. 2468; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c.
### Chunk 1970

4, s. 274. III. — Payment of the premium 1991, c. 64, Sd. III; I. N. 20140501. 2469. The insurer is entitled to the premium only from the time the risk begins, and only for its duration if the risk disappears completely as a result of an event that is not covered by the insurance. The insurer may bring an action for payment of the premium or deduct it from the indemnity payable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2469.

### Chunk 1971

— Notice of loss and payment of indemnity 2470. The insured shall notify the insurer of any loss which may fall under the coverage, as soon as he becomes aware of it. Any interested person may give such notice. An insurer who has not been so notified, and thereby suffers injury, may set up against the insured any clause of the policy providing for forfeiture of the right to indemnity in such a case. 1991, c. 64, a. 2470; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 275. 2471. At the request of the insurer, the insured shall inform the insurer as soon as possible of all the circumstances surrounding the loss, including its probable cause, the nature and extent of the damage, the location of the insured property, the rights of third persons, and any concurrent insurance; he shall also provide the insurer with vouchers and attest under oath to the truth of the information.

Where, for a serious reason, the insured is unable to fulfil that obligation, he is entitled to a reasonable time in which to do so. If the insured fails to fulfil his obligation, any interested person may do so on his behalf. 1991, c. 64, a. 2471; I. N. 20140501. 2472. Any deceitful representation entails the loss of the right of the person making it to any indemnity for the risk to which the representation relates. However, if the occurrence of the risk insured against has entailed the loss of both movable and immovable property or of both property for occupational use and personal property, forfeiture is incurred only with respect to the class of property to which the representation relates.
### Chunk 1973

1991, c. 64, a. 2472; I. N. 20140501. 2473.

N. 20140501. 2474. The insurer is subrogated to the rights of the insured against the author of the injury, up to the amount of indemnity paid. The insurer may be fully or partly released from his obligation towards the insured where, owing to an act or omission of the insured, he cannot be so subrogated.
### Chunk 1974

The insurer may never be subrogated against persons who are members of the household of the insured. 1991, c. 64, a. 2474; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 277. V. — Assignment 2475. A contract of insurance may be assigned only with the consent of the insurer and in favour of a person who has an insurable interest in the insured property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2475. 2476. Upon the death or bankruptcy of the insured or the assignment of his interest in the insurance to a coinsured, the insurance continues in favour of the heir, trustee in bankruptcy or remaining insured, subject to his performing the obligations to which the insured was bound.

The insurer may cancel the contract on prior notice which shall be sent to every insured named in the policy. The cancellation takes place 15 days after notice is received by the insured at his last known address. A contract of insurance may also be cancelled on mere notice in writing given to the insurer by each of the insured named in the policy.
### Chunk 1976

The cancellation takes place upon receipt of the notice. The insured named in the policy may, however, give one or more of their number the mandate of receiving or sending the notice of cancellation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2477. 2478. Where the right to the indemnity has been hypothecated and notice to that effect has been given to the insurer, the contract may not be cancelled or amended to the detriment of the hypothecary creditor unless the insurer has given him prior notice of at least 15 days.
### Chunk 1977

1991, c. 64, a. 2478; I. N. 20140501. 2479. Where the insurance is cancelled, the insurer is entitled to only the earned portion of the premium, computed day by day if the contract is cancelled by the insurer, or at the shortterm rate if it is cancelled by the insured; the insurer is bound to refund any overpayment of premium. 1991, c. 64, a. 2479; I. N. 20140501. 2479. 1. If the insured has assigned or hypothecated his right to a premium overpayment refund to or in favour of the person who paid the premium and the insurer has received notice of the assignment or hypothec, the insurer is bound to make the overpayment refund to the assignee or to the holder of the hypothec.
### Chunk 1978

The assignment or hypothec may not be set up against third persons until the insurer receives notice of the assignment or hypothec. If two or more assignments or hypothecs are made or granted on the same right to a premium overpayment refund, priority is determined according to when the insurer received notice. 2008, c. 20, s. 131. § 2. — Property insurance I. — Content of the policy 1991, c. 64, Sd. I; I. N. 20140501. 2480.

Property insurance may be contracted on behalf of whomever it may concern. The clause is valid as insurance for the benefit of the policyholder or as a stipulation for another in favour of the beneficiary of the clause, whether known or potential. The policyholder alone is liable for payment of the premium to the insurer; any exception that the insurer may set up against him may also be set up against the beneficiary of the contract, whoever he may be.
### Chunk 1981

1991, c. 64, a. 2483; I. N. 20140501. 2484. The insurance of property in which the insured has no insurable interest is null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2484; I. N. 20140501. III. — Extent of coverage 2485. In fire insurance, the insurer is bound to make reparation for the injury which is an immediate consequence of fire or combustion, whatever the cause, including damage to the property during removal or that caused by the means employed to extinguish the fire, subject to the exceptions specified in the policy.
### Chunk 1982

The insurer also covers the disappearance of insured things that occurs during the fire, unless he proves that the disappearance is due to theft which is not covered. The insurer is not bound to make reparation for the injury caused solely by excessive heat from a heating apparatus or by any process involving the application of heat where there is no fire or commencement of fire but, even where there is no fire, the insurer is bound to make reparation for the injury caused by lightning or the explosion of fuel.

— Amount of coverage 1991, c. 64, Sd. IV; I. N. 20140501. 2490. The value of the insured property is determined in the ordinary manner unless a special valuation formula is contained in the policy. 1991, c. 64, a. 2490. 2491. In unvalued contracts, the amount of the coverage does not make proof of the value of the insured property. In valued contracts, the agreed value makes complete proof, between the insurer and the insured, of the value of the insured property. 1991, c.
### Chunk 1986

64, a. 2491; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 279. 2492.

N. 20140501. 2493. The insurer may not refuse to cover a risk for the sole reason that the amount of the coverage is less than the value of the insured property. In such a case, he is released by paying the amount of the coverage in the event of total loss or a proportional indemnity in the event of partial loss.
### Chunk 1987

1991, c. 64, a. 2493; I. N. 20140501. V. — Losses, and payment of indemnity 2494. Subject to the rights of prior and hypothecary creditors, the insurer may reserve the right to repair, rebuild or replace the insured property.

Any person who, without fraud, is insured by several insurers, under several policies, for the same interest and against the same risk, so that the total amount of indemnity that would result from the separate performance of such policies would exceed the loss incurred, may be indemnified by the insurer or insurers of his choice, each being liable only for the amount he has contracted for.
### Chunk 1989

No clause suspending all or part of the performance of the contract by reason of plurality of insurance may be set up against the insured. Unless otherwise agreed, the indemnity is apportioned among the insurers in proportion to the share of each in the total coverage, except with respect to specific insurance, which constitutes primary insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2496; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 444 of 556 ### Page 445 2497.
### Chunk 1990

Notwithstanding any contrary provision, the indemnities due to the insured are apportioned among the prior creditors or creditors holding hypothecs on the damaged property, according to their rank and without express delegation, upon mere notice and proof by them. However, payments made in good faith before the notice discharge the insurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2497. § 3. — Liability insurance 2498.

An injured third person may bring an action directly against the insured or against the insurer, or against both. The option chosen in that regard by the injured third person does not deprive him of his other recourses. 1991, c. 64, a. 2501; I. N. 20140501. 2502. The insurer may set up against the injured third person any grounds he could have invoked against the insured at the time of the loss, but not grounds pertaining to facts that occurred after the loss; the insurer has a recursory action against the insured with respect to facts that occurred after the loss.
### Chunk 1993

1991, c. 64, a. 2502; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 282. 2503. The insurer is bound to take up the interest of any person entitled to the benefit of the insurance and assume his defence in any action brought against him. Legal costs and expenses resulting from actions against the insured, including those of the defence, and interest on the proceeds of the insurance are borne by the insurer over and above the proceeds of the insurance. However, the Government may, by regulation, determine categories of insurance contracts that may depart from those rules and from the rule set out in article 2500, as well as classes of insureds that may be covered by such contracts.
### Chunk 1994

The Government may also prescribe any standard applicable to those contracts. 1991, c. 64, a. 2503; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2021, c. 15, s. 84. 2504. No transaction made without the consent of the insurer may be set up against him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2504.

In addition to providing coverage against the losses incident to marine adventure, marine insurance may cover the risks of any adventure analogous to a marine adventure, land risks which are incidental to a marine adventure or risks incident to the building, repair and launch of a ship.
### Chunk 1995

1991, c. 64, a. 2505. 2506. In particular, there is a marine adventure where any ship, goods or other movables are exposed to maritime perils or where by reason of such perils, civil liability may be incurred by any person interested in insurable property. There is also a marine adventure where the earning or acquisition of any freight, passage money, commission or other pecuniary benefit, or the security for any advances, loan or disbursements, is endangered by the exposure of insurable property to maritime perils.
### Chunk 1996

1991, c. 64, a. 2506; I. N. 20151101. 2507. Maritime perils include the perils designated by the policy and the perils consequent on or incidental to navigation such as perils of the sea, piracy, restraints, jettisons and barratry, and the capture, restraint, seizure or detainment of the ship or other insurable property by a government. 1991, c. 64, a. 2507. 2508. The insurance of a ship covers the hull of the ship as well as her outfit, stores and provisions, the machinery and boilers and, in the case of a ship engaged in a special trade, the ordinary fittings requisite for that trade, and, if owned by the insured, the bunkers and engine stores.
### Chunk 1997

1991, c. 64, a. 2508. 2509. Insurance on freight covers the profit derivable by a shipowner from the employment of his ship to carry his own goods or other movables as well as freight payable by a third person, but does not include passage money. 1991, c. 64, a. 2509; I.

It is not necessary that the insurable interest exist when the contract is made but it is necessary that it exist at the time of the loss.
### Chunk 1998

The acquisition of an interest after a loss does not validate the insurance. However, where the property is insured “lost or not lost”, the insurance is valid although the insured may not have acquired his interest until after the loss provided that, at the time of making the contract, the insured was not aware of the loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2511. 2512. Every contract of marine insurance by way of gaming or wagering is absolutely null. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 446 of 556 ### Page 447 There is a gaming or wagering contract where the insured has no insurable interest and the contract is entered into with no expectation of acquiring such an interest.
### Chunk 1999

A contract of marine insurance is deemed to be a gaming or wagering contract where the policy is made “interest or no interest” or “without further proof of interest than the policy itself”, or “without benefit of abandonment to the insurer” where there is in fact a possibility of abandonment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2512. II. — Instances of insurable interest 2513. An insurable interest exists where a person is interested in a marine adventure and, in particular, where the relation between that person and the adventure or the insurable property is such that he may incur liability in respect thereof or derive benefit from the safety or due arrival of the insurable property or be prejudiced in case of detainment, loss or damage.
### Chunk 2000

1991, c. 64, a. 2513; I. N. 20140501. 2514. An insurable interest subject to annulment, or that is contingent or partial, may be the subject of a contract of marine insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2514; 2016, c. 4, s. 283. 2515. An insurable interest exists, in particular, for the insurer in respect of the risk insured, for the insured in respect of the charges of insurance effected and the solvency of his insurer and for the master or any member of the crew of a ship in respect of his wages.
### Chunk 2001

An insurable interest also exists for the person advancing freight so far as it is not repayable in case of loss, for the buyer of goods even where he is entitled to reject the goods or treat them as at the seller’s risk, for the hypothecary debtor in respect of the full value of the hypothecated property, and for the hypothecary creditor up to the amount of his claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2515; I.

The insurable value is the amount at the risk of the insured when the contract is formed. The insurable value includes the charges of insurance on the property.

1991, c. 64, a. 2518; 2016, c. 4, s. 284. 2519. In insurance on ship, the insurable value is the value of the ship plus the money advanced for seamen’s wages and any other disbursements incurred to make the ship fit for the voyage or adventure contemplated by the policy.

A valued contract is a contract which specifies the agreed value of the insured property. In the absence of fraud, the value fixed by the contract is, as between the insurer and the insured, conclusive of the value of the insured property whether the loss be total or partial, but is not conclusive for the purpose of determining whether there has been a constructive total loss.
### Chunk 2006

1991, c. 64, a. 2523; 2016, c. 4, s. 286. 2524. An unvalued contract is a contract which does not specify the value of the insured property but, without exceeding the amount of coverage, leaves the insurable value to be subsequently ascertained. Where a declaration of the value of an insured property is not made until after notice of loss or arrival, the contract is treated as an unvalued contract as regards that property, unless the policy provides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2007

2524. 2525. A floating contract is a contract which describes the insurance in general terms and leaves the necessary particulars such as the name of the ship to be defined by subsequent declaration. 1991, c. 64, a. 2525. 2526. Declarations may be made by endorsement on the policy or in other other customary manner but, where they pertain to goods to be dispatched or shipped, they shall, unless the policy provides otherwise, be made in the order of dispatch or shipment, state the value of the goods and comprise all consignments within the terms of the policy.

A marine policy may be assigned by endorsement on the policy or in other customary manner. 1991, c. 64, a. 2528; I. N. 20140501. 2529. Where the insured has alienated or lost his interest in the insured property, and has not, before or at the time of so doing expressly or impliedly agreed to assign the policy, he may not subsequently assign the policy.
### Chunk 2010

1991, c. 64, a. 2529. 2530. The alienation of the insured property does not entail assignment of the insurance except in the case of a transmission by operation of law or by succession in favour of an heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 2530; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 287. 2531.

### Chunk 2011

64, a. 2531. V. — Evidence and ratification of the contract 2532. A contract is inadmissible in evidence unless it is embodied in an insurance policy, but once the policy has been issued, customary memorandums of the contract such as the slip or covering note are admissible in evidence, in particular for the purpose of determining the actual terms of the contract and showing when the proposal was accepted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2532; 2016, c. 4, s. 288. 2533.

1991, c. 64, a. 2535. 2536. Where a marine policy is effected on behalf of the insured by a broker, the broker is responsible to the insurer for the premium. In other cases, the insured is responsible. 1991, c. 64, a. 2536. 2537. The insurer is responsible to the insured for the amounts payable. In the event of a loss or a return of premium, the insurer is responsible to the insured for such amounts whether or not he has collected the premium from the broker. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2014

2537; I. N. 20140501. 2538. Where the consideration for the payment of the premium totally fails and there has been no fraud or illegality on the part of the insured, the premium is returnable to the insured. Where the consideration for the payment of the premium is apportionable and there is a total failure of any apportionable part of the consideration, a proportionate part of the premium is, under the same conditions, returnable to the insured. 1991, c. 64, a. 2538; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 2015

2539. Where the policy is null or is cancelled by the insurer before the commencement of the risk, the premium is returnable provided there has been no fraud or illegality on the part of the insured; but if the risk is not apportionable, and has once attached, the premium is not returnable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2539. 2540. Where the insured property, or part thereof, has never been imperilled, the premium, or a proportionate part thereof, is returnable. Where the property has been insured “lost or not lost” and has arrived in safety at the time when the contract is concluded, the premium is not returnable unless, at such time, the insurer knew of the safe arrival.

Where the insured has no insurable interest throughout the currency of the risk, the premium is returnable, provided the contract was not effected by way of gaming or wagering. Where the insured has an interest subject to annulment which is terminated during the currency of the risk, the premium is not returnable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2541. 2542. Where the insured has overinsured under an unvalued contract, a proportionate part of the premium is returnable.
### Chunk 2017

The same applies in the case of overinsurance resulting from several contracts, if effected without the knowledge of the insured. But if the contracts have become effective at different times, and any of the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 450 of 556 ### Page 451 contracts has, at any time, borne the entire risk or if an indemnity has been paid by the insurer in respect of the full sum insured thereby, no premium is returnable in respect of that contract.
### Chunk 2018

1991, c. 64, a. 2542; I. N. 20140501. 2543. The broker has a right of retention upon the policy for the amount of the premium and his charges in respect of effecting the policy. Where the broker has dealt with a person as if that person was acting on his own account, he also has a right of retention upon the policy in respect of any balance on any insurance account which may be due to him from such person, unless, when the debt was incurred, he had good reason to believe that such person was acting only on behalf of another.
### Chunk 2019

1991, c. 64, a. 2543; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 289. 2544. Where a policy effected by a broker acknowledges the receipt of the premium, the acknowledgement is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive as between the insurer and the insured, but not as between the insurer and the broker. 1991, c. 64, a. 2544. § 6. — Disclosure and representations 2545. A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith. If the utmost good faith is not observed by either party, the other party may apply to have the contract annulled.
### Chunk 2020

1991, c. 64, a. 2545; I. N. 20140501. 2546. The insured shall disclose to the insurer, before the formation of the contract, all circumstances known to him which would materially influence an insurer in fixing the premium, appreciating the risk or determining whether he will take it; the insured shall make only true representations. Circumstances requiring disclosure include any communication made to or information received by the insured. 1991, c. 64, a. 2546. 2547. In the absence of inquiry, the insured is not bound to disclose circumstances which diminish the risk and circumstances which it is superfluous to disclose by reason of an express or implied warranty.
### Chunk 2021

Similarly, the insured is not bound to disclose matters of notoriety or circumstances which are known to the insurer or as to which information is waived by the insurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2547; I. N. 20140501. 2548. A representation as to a matter of fact is deemed true if the difference between what is represented and what is actually correct would not materially influence the judgment of an insurer. A representation as to a matter of expectation or belief is deemed true if it is made in good faith.
### Chunk 2022

1991, c. 64, a. 2548. 2549. Where insurance is effected for an insured by a representative of the insured, the representative is subject to the same obligations as the insured with respect to representations and disclosures. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 451 of 556 ### Page 452 However, no omission is attributable to the representative with respect to circumstances which came to the knowledge of the insured too late to be communicated to him.
### Chunk 2023

1991, c. 64, a. 2549; I. N. 20140501. 2550. The insured and the insurer as well as their representatives are deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, they ought to know. 1991, c. 64, a. 2550; I. N. 20140501. 2551. A representation may be withdrawn or corrected before the formation of the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2551. 2552. Any omission or misrepresentation on the part of the insured nullifies the contract at the instance of the insurer, even with respect to losses not connected with the risks misrepresented or not disclosed.
### Chunk 2024

1991, c. 64, a. 2552; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. § 7. — Warranties 2553. A warranty is an undertaking by the insured whereby he affirms or denies the existence of a particular state of facts or promises that some particular thing will or will not be done or that some condition will be fulfilled. The affirmation or denial of a particular state of facts necessarily implies that the state of facts will not vary. 1991, c. 64, a. 2553; I. N. 20140501. 2554. A warranty shall be exactly complied with whether or not it may materially influence the judgment of an insurer.
### Chunk 2025

Where a warranty is not so complied with, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the time of the breach of warranty with respect to any loss which occurs subsequently; the insured may not avail himself of the defence that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, before the loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2554; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2555. The insured is not required to comply with a warranty which has become unlawful or which has ceased, by reason of a change of circumstances, to be applicable to the circumstances of the contract.
### Chunk 2026

1991, c. 64, a. 2555. 2556. A warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty may be in any form of words but shall be written in the policy or contained in a document incorporated into the policy by way of a rider. An express warranty does not exclude an implied warranty, unless it is inconsistent therewith. 1991, c. 64, a. 2556. 2557. Where insurable property, whether ship or goods, is expressly warranted “neutral”, there is an implied warranty that the property will have a neutral character at the commencement of the risk and that, so far as the insured can control the matter, its neutral character will be preserved during the risk.
### Chunk 2027

Where a ship is expressly warranted “neutral” there is also an implied warranty that, so far as the insured can control the matter, she will carry the necessary papers to establish her neutrality and that she will not CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 452 of 556 ### Page 453 falsify or suppress her papers or use simulated papers. If any loss occurs through breach of this implied warranty, the insurer may bring an action for the annulment of the contract.
### Chunk 2028

1991, c. 64, a. 2557. 2558. There is no implied warranty as to the nationality of a ship, or that her nationality will not be changed during the risk. 1991, c. 64, a. 2558. 2559. Where the insured property is warranted well or in good safety on a particular day, it is sufficient if it be safe at any time during that day. 1991, c. 64, a. 2559. 2560. In a voyage contract, there is an implied warranty that at the commencement of the voyage the ship will be seaworthy for the purpose of the marine adventure insured.
### Chunk 2029

Where the risk attaches while the ship is in port, there is also an implied warranty that, at the commencement of the risk, she will be fit to encounter the ordinary perils of the port; where the different stages of a voyage require different kinds of or further preparation or equipment for the ship, there is an implied warranty that the ship will be seaworthy at the commencement of each stage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2560; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 290. 2561. In a time contract there is no implied warranty that the ship is seaworthy.
### Chunk 2030

Where, with the knowledge of the insured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to such unseaworthiness. 1991, c. 64, a. 2561; 2016, c. 4, s. 290. 2562. A ship is deemed to be seaworthy when she is fit in all respects to encounter the ordinary perils of the seas of the marine adventure insured. 1991, c. 64, a. 2562; I. N. 20151101. 2563. In a contract of insurance on goods or other movables, there is no implied warranty that the goods or movables are seaworthy.
### Chunk 2031

However, in a voyage contract there is an implied warranty that, at the commencement of the voyage, the ship is seaworthy and that she is fit to carry the goods or movables to the destination contemplated. 1991, c. 64, a. 2563; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 291. 2564. There is an implied warranty that the marine adventure insured is not unlawful and that, so far as the insured can control the matter, it will be carried out in a lawful manner. 1991, c. 64, a. 2564; I. N.
### Chunk 2032

20151101. § 8. — The voyage I. — Commencement 2565. In a voyage contract there is an implied condition that if, when the contract is made, the ship is not at the place of departure specified therein, the marine adventure will nevertheless commence within a reasonable time. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 453 of 556 ### Page 454 If the marine adventure is not so commenced, the insurer may apply for the annulment of the contract unless the insured shows that the delay was caused by circumstances known to the insurer before the contract was made.
### Chunk 2033

1991, c. 64, a. 2565; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2566. Where the ship sails from a place other than the place of departure specified in the contract the risk does not attach. The same applies where the ship sails for a destination other than that specified in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2566. II. — Change of voyage 2567. There is a change of voyage from such time as, after the commencement of the risk, the determination to voluntarily change the destination specified in the contract is manifested.
### Chunk 2034

The insurer is discharged from liability from the time of the change whether or not the course has in fact been changed when the loss occurs. 1991, c. 64, a. 2567. III. — Deviation 2568. There is a deviation where the ship departs in fact from the course specified in the contract or, if none is specified, where the usual and customary course is departed from. The insurer is discharged from liability from the time of a deviation without lawful excuse, whether or not the ship has regained her course before any loss occurs.
### Chunk 2035

1991, c. 64, a. 2568; I. N. 20140501. 2569. Where several places of discharge are specified in the contract, the ship may proceed to all or any of them. However, in the absence of any usage or lawful excuse to the contrary, the ship shall proceed to such of the places as she goes to in the order specified in the contract; if she does not, there is a deviation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2569; I. N. 20140501. 2570. Where several places of discharge within a given area are referred to in the contract in general terms but are not named, the ship shall, in the absence of any usage or lawful excuse to the contrary, proceed to such of them as she goes to in their geographical order; if she does not, there is a deviation.
### Chunk 2036

1991, c. 64, a. 2570. IV. — Delay 2571. In the case of a voyage contract, the marine adventure shall be prosecuted with dispatch and if, without lawful excuse, it is not so prosecuted, the insurer is discharged from liability from the time when the lack of dispatch becomes manifest. 1991, c. 64, a. 2571; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 454 of 556 ### Page 455 V. — Excuses for deviation or delay 2572.
### Chunk 2037

Deviation or delay in prosecuting the voyage is excused where authorized by the contract or necessary in order to comply with an express or implied warranty or where caused by circumstances beyond the control of the master and his employer or necessary for the safety of the insured property. Deviation or delay is also excused where it occurs for the purpose of saving human life or aiding a ship in distress where human life may be in danger or where necessary for the purpose of obtaining medical or surgical aid for any person on board the ship, or where caused by the barratrous conduct of the master or crew, provided barratry is one of the perils insured against.
### Chunk 2038

1991, c. 64, a. 2572. 2573. When the cause excusing the deviation or delay ceases to operate, the ship shall resume her course and prosecute her voyage with reasonable dispatch. 1991, c. 64, a. 2573; I. N. 20140501. 2574. Where, by the occurrence of a peril insured against, the voyage is interrupted at an intermediate place under such circumstances as, apart from any special stipulation in the contract of affreightment, to justify the master in landing and reshipping the goods or other movables, or in transhipping them, and sending them on to their destination, the liability of the insurer continues.
### Chunk 2039

1991, c. 64, a. 2574; I. N. 20140501. § 9. — Notice of loss 2575. The notice of loss is governed by the rules applicable in nonmarine damage insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2575. 2576. The insurer is liable only for losses directly caused by a peril insured against. The insurer is not liable for any such loss caused by the insured’s intentional fault, but he is liable if it is caused by fault on the part of the master or crew. 1991, c. 64, a. 2576; I. N. 20140501. 2577.
### Chunk 2040

The insurer on ship or goods is not liable for any loss directly caused by delay, even though the delay is attributable to the occurrence of a peril insured against. The insurer is also not liable for any injury to machinery not directly caused by maritime perils nor for any loss directly caused by rats or vermin, ordinary wear and tear, ordinary leakage and breakage during a voyage, or the very nature of the insured property or any inherent defect in it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2577; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 2041

2578. A loss may be either total or partial. A total loss may be either an actual total loss or a constructive total loss. Only a loss contemplated by this subsection may be considered a total loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2578. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 455 of 556 ### Page 456 2579. Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, insurance against total loss includes a constructive total loss as well as an actual total loss.
### Chunk 2042

1991, c. 64, a. 2579; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 292. 2580. There is an actual total loss where the insured is irretrievably deprived of the insured property or where it is destroyed or so damaged as to cease to be a thing of the kind insured. An actual total loss may be presumed where the ship is missing and no news of her has been received for a reasonable period of time. 1991, c. 64, a. 2580. 2581. There is a constructive total loss where the insured property is abandoned on account of its actual total loss appearing to be unavoidable, or because it could not be preserved from actual total loss without an expenditure which would exceed the value of the insured property.
### Chunk 2043

There is also a constructive total loss where the insured is deprived of the possession of the insured property by a peril insured against and it is either unlikely that he can recover it, or too costly to attempt to do so; there is also constructive total loss where repairing the damage to the insured property would be too costly. 1991, c. 64, a. 2581. 2582. Recovery or repair is presumed to be too costly where the cost would exceed the value of the insured property at the time the expense was incurred or where the cost of repairing the damage and forwarding the goods to their destination would exceed their value on arrival or where the cost of repairing the damage to the ship would exceed the value of the ship when repaired.
### Chunk 2044

1991, c. 64, a. 2582. 2583. In estimating the cost of repairs, no deduction is to be made in respect of general average contributions to those repairs payable by other interests. However, account is to be taken of the expense of future salvage operations and of any future general average contributions to which the ship would be liable if repaired. 1991, c. 64, a. 2583. 2584. Where there is a constructive total loss, the insured may either treat the loss as a partial loss, or abandon the insured property to the insurer and treat the loss as if it were an actual total loss.
### Chunk 2045

1991, c. 64, a. 2584. 2585. Where the insured brings an action for a total loss and the evidence proves only a partial loss, he may nevertheless recover for a partial loss, unless partial losses are not covered by the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2585. 2586. Where goods that have reached their destination are incapable of identification by reason of obliteration of marks or otherwise, the insured has a right of action for partial loss only. 1991, c. 64, a. 2586. § 10. — Abandonment 2587.
### Chunk 2046

Where the insured elects to abandon the insured property, he shall give notice of abandonment, except in the case of total actual loss. If he fails to do so, he has a right of action for partial loss only. 1991, c. 64, a. 2587. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 456 of 556 ### Page 457 2588. There are no special requirements as to the form or substance of the notice of abandonment but the insured shall make his intention to effect unconditional abandonment manifest.
### Chunk 2047

1991, c. 64, a. 2588. 2589. Notice of abandonment shall be given with diligence after the receipt of reliable information of the loss. Where the information is of a doubtful character the insured is entitled to a reasonable time to make inquiry. 1991, c. 64, a. 2589. 2590. Notice of abandonment is unnecessary if, at the time the insured receives information of the loss, there would be no possibility of benefit to the insurer if notice were given to him. 1991, c. 64, a. 2590.
### Chunk 2048

2591. The insurer need not give notice of the abandonment to his reinsurer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2591. 2592. The insurer may either accept or refuse an abandonment validly tendered. He may also waive notice of abandonment. The acceptance of an abandonment may be either express or implied from the conduct of the insurer, but the mere silence of the insurer is not an acceptance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2592. 2593. The acceptance of the notice admits sufficiency of the notice, renders the abandonment irrevocable and conclusively admits the insurer’s obligation to indemnify the insured.
### Chunk 2049

1991, c. 64, a. 2593; I. N. 20140501. 2594. Where the insurer accepts the abandonment, he becomes, from the time of the loss, the owner of the interest of the insured in whatever may remain of the insured property and all rights and obligations incidental thereto. An insurer who has accepted the abandonment of a ship is entitled to any freight earned after the loss, less the expenses of earning it incurred after the loss. And, where the ship is carrying the ship owner’s goods, the insurer is entitled to a reasonable remuneration for the carriage of them subsequent to the loss.
### Chunk 2050

1991, c. 64, a. 2594. 2595. Where the notice of abandonment is properly given, the rights of the insured, particularly the right of recovery for a constructive total loss, are not prejudiced by the fact that the insurer refuses to accept the abandonment. The insured retains his interest in whatever may remain of the insured property and all incidental rights and obligations, even if the insurer indemnifies him for the loss which gave rise to the abandonment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2595; I.
### Chunk 2051

N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 457 of 556 ### Page 458 § 11. — Kinds of average loss 2596. A particular average loss is a partial loss of the insured property, caused by a peril insured against, and which is not a general average loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2596. 2597. Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the insured for the preservation or safety of the insured property, other than general average and salvage charges, are called particular charges.
### Chunk 2052

Particular charges are not included in particular average. 1991, c. 64, a. 2597. 2598. Salvage charges incurred in preventing a loss by perils insured against may be recovered as a loss by those perils. “Salvage charges” means the charges recoverable under maritime law by a salvor independently of contract. They do not include the expenses of services in the nature of salvage rendered by the insured or by his mandatary, or any person employed for hire by them, for the sole purpose of averting a peril insured against, unless such expenses are properly incurred, in which case they may be recovered as particular charges or as a general average loss, according to the circumstances in which they were incurred.
### Chunk 2053

1991, c. 64, a. 2598; 2016, c. 4, s. 293. 2599. A general average loss is a loss caused by a general average act. There is a general average act where any extraordinary sacrifice or expense is voluntarily and reasonably made or incurred in time of peril for the purpose of preserving the property imperilled. 1991, c. 64, a. 2599; I. N. 20140501. 2600. Where there is a general average loss, the party on whom it falls is entitled, subject to the conditions imposed by maritime law, to a rateable contribution from the other interested persons, and such contribution is called a general average contribution.
### Chunk 2054

1991, c. 64, a. 2600; I. N. 20140501. 2601. Where the insured has incurred a general average expenditure, he may recover from the insurer in respect of the proportion of the loss which falls upon him, if any; in the case of a general average sacrifice, he may recover from the insurer in respect of the whole loss without having enforced his right of contribution from the other parties. 1991, c. 64, a. 2601. 2602. The insurer is not bound to indemnify for any general average loss or contribution where the loss was not incurred for the purpose of avoiding, or in connection with the avoidance of, a peril insured against.
### Chunk 2055

1991, c. 64, a. 2602; I. N. 20140501. 2603. Where the ship, freight, and cargo, or other movable property, or any two of them, are owned by the same insured, the liability of the insurer in respect of general average losses or contributions is to be determined as if the property were owned by different persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 2603; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 458 of 556 ### Page 459 § 12. — Measure of indemnity 2604.
### Chunk 2056

The measure of indemnity is the sum recoverable, to the full extent of the insurable value in the case of an unvalued contract or, in the case of a valued contract, to the full extent of the value fixed in the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2604; 2016, c. 4, s. 294. 2605. Where there is a loss recoverable under the contract, the insurer, or each insurer if there is more than one, is liable for such proportion of the measure of indemnity as the amount of his subscription bears to the value fixed in the contract in the case of a valued contract, or to the insurable value in the case of an unvalued contract.
### Chunk 2057

1991, c. 64, a. 2605; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 294. 2606. The measure of indemnity for a total loss is the sum fixed in the contract in the case of a valued contract, or the insurable value of the insured property in the case of an unvalued contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2606; 2016, c. 4, s. 294. 2607. Where freight is lost, the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed in the contract, in the case of a valued contract, or of the insurable value, in the case of an unvalued contract, as the proportion of freight lost bears to the whole insured freight.
### Chunk 2058

1991, c. 64, a. 2607; 2016, c. 4, s. 294. 2608. Where a ship is damaged, but is not totally lost, the measure of indemnity is as follows: (1) where the ship has been repaired, the insured is entitled to the reasonable cost of the repairs, less the customary deductions, but not exceeding the sum insured in respect of any one casualty; (2) where the ship has been only partially repaired, the insured is entitled to the reasonable cost of such repairs computed as in paragraph 1, and also to be indemnified for the reasonable depreciation arising from the unrepaired damage, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed the cost of repairing the whole damage; (3) where the ship has not been repaired, and has not been sold in her damaged state during the risk, the insured is entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable depreciation arising from the unrepaired damage, but not exceeding the reasonable cost of repairing such damage, computed as in paragraph 1.
### Chunk 2059

1991, c. 64, a. 2608. 2609. Where part of the goods or other movable property insured by a valued contract is totally lost, the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed in the contract as the insurable value of the part lost bears to the insurable value of the whole, ascertained as in the case of an unvalued contract. Where part of the property insured by an unvalued contract is totally lost, the measure of indemnity is the insurable value of the part lost, ascertained as in case of total loss.
### Chunk 2060

1991, c. 64, a. 2609. 2610. Where the whole or any part of the goods or other movable property insured has been delivered damaged at its destination, the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed or, as the case may be, of the insurable value, as the difference between the gross sound and damaged values bears to the gross sound value. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 459 of 556 ### Page 460 “Gross value” means the wholesale price at destination or, if there is no such price, the estimated value of the property with, in either case, freight, landing charges and duty paid beforehand or, in the case of goods customarily sold in bond, the bonded price.
### Chunk 2061

1991, c. 64, a. 2610. 2611. Where different species of property are insured under a single valuation, the valuation is apportioned over the different species in proportion to their respective insurable values; similarly, the insured value of any part of a species is such proportion of the total insured value of that species as the insurable value of the part bears to the insurable value of the whole. Where the valuation of the insured value of different species of goods has to be apportioned, and particulars of the invoice value, quality, or description of each separate species cannot be ascertained, the division of the valuation may be made over the net arrived sound values of the goods.
### Chunk 2062

1991, c. 64, a. 2611. 2612. Where the insured has paid, or is liable for, any general average contribution, the measure of indemnity is the full amount of such contribution if the property is insured for its full contributory value; if the property is not insured for its full contributory value or if only part of it is insured, the indemnity is reduced in proportion to the underinsurance. The amount awarded as compensation for injury suffered by the insured by reason of a particular average loss which constitutes a deduction from the contributory value, and for which the insurer is liable, shall be deducted from the insured value in order to ascertain what the insurer is liable to contribute.
### Chunk 2063

The extent of the insurer’s liability for salvage charges is determined on the same principles. 1991, c. 64, a. 2612; I. N. 20140501. 2613. The measure of indemnity recoverable under a civil liability insurance contract is the sum paid or payable to third persons, up to the amount of the coverage. 1991, c. 64, a. 2613; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2614. Where the loss sustained is not expressly provided for in this subsection, the measure of indemnity is ascertained, as nearly as may be, in accordance with this subsection.
### Chunk 2064

1991, c. 64, a. 2614. 2615. Where the insured property is warranted free from particular average, the insured may not recover for a loss of part of the insured property other than a loss incurred by a general average sacrifice, unless the contract is apportionable. If the contract is apportionable, the insured may recover for a total loss of any apportionable part of the insured property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2615. 2616. Where the insured property is warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under a certain percentage, the insurer is nevertheless liable for salvage charges, and for particular charges and other expenses properly incurred pursuant to the provisions of the suing and labouring clause in order to avert a loss insured against.
### Chunk 2065

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 460 of 556 ### Page 461 A general average loss may not be added to a particular average loss to make up the percentage stipulated in the contract. Likewise, no regard is had to particular charges and the expenses of and incidental to ascertaining the loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2616. 2617. Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the insurer is liable for successive losses, even though the total amount of such losses may exceed the sum insured.
### Chunk 2066

However, where a partial loss which has not been the subject of repairs or replacement is followed by a total loss, the insured may only recover under the same contract in respect of the total loss. The liability of the insurer under the suing and labouring clause is not affected. 1991, c. 64, a. 2617; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 294. 2618. A suing and labouring clause is deemed to be supplementary to the contract of insurance; the insured may recover from the insurer any expenses properly incurred pursuant to the clause, notwithstanding that the insurer may have paid for a total loss, or that the property may have been warranted free from particular average, either wholly or under a certain percentage.
### Chunk 2067

General average losses and contributions, salvage charges, and expenses incurred for the purpose of averting or diminishing any loss not covered by the contract are not recoverable under the suing and labouring clause. 1991, c. 64, a. 2618. 2619. It is the duty of the insured and of his representatives, in all cases, to take reasonable measures for the purpose of averting or minimizing a loss. 1991, c. 64, a. 2619; I. N. 20140501. § 13. — Miscellaneous provisions I. — Subrogation 2620.
### Chunk 2068

Where the insurer indemnifies the insured for a total loss, either of the whole, or, in the case of goods, of any apportionable part of the insured property, he becomes entitled to take over the interest of the insured in whatever may remain of the property so insured and he is thereby subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the insured in and in respect of the insured property from the time of the event causing the loss. However, where the insurer indemnifies the insured for a particular average loss, he acquires no right to the insured property, or to any part of it that may remain, but he is thereupon subrogated to all rights and remedies of the insured in or in respect of the property from the time of the event causing the loss, up to the indemnity paid.
### Chunk 2069

1991, c. 64, a. 2620; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 295. II. — Double insurance 2621. Where two or more insurance policies are effected by or on behalf of the insured on the same marine adventure and interest or any part thereof and the sums insured exceed the indemnity recoverable, the insured is said to be overinsured by double insurance. 1991, c. 64, a. 2621; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 461 of 556 ### Page 462 2622.
### Chunk 2070

Where the insured is overinsured by double insurance, he may claim payment from the insurers in such order as he may think fit, but in no case is he entitled to receive any sum in excess of the indemnity recoverable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2622. 2623. Where the contract under which the insured claims is a valued contract, the insured shall give credit as against the valuation for any sum received by him under any other contract without regard to the actual value of the insured property. Where the contract under which the insured claims is an unvalued contract, the insured shall give credit, as against the full insurable value, for any sum received by him under any other contract.
### Chunk 2071

1991, c. 64, a. 2623; 2016, c. 4, s. 296. 2624. Where the insured receives any sum in excess of the indemnity recoverable, he is deemed to hold such sum on behalf of the insurers according to their right of contribution among themselves. 1991, c. 64, a. 2624. 2625. Where the insured is overinsured by double insurance, each insurer is bound, as between himself and the other insurers, to contribute to the loss rateably to the amount for which he is liable under his contract.
### Chunk 2072

If any insurer pays more than his proportion of the loss, he is entitled to recover the excess from the other insurers in the same manner as a surety who has paid more than his proportion of the debt. 1991, c. 64, a. 2625. III. — Underinsurance 2626. Where the insured is insured for an amount less than the insurable value or, in the case of a valued contract, for an amount less than the contract valuation, the insured is his own insurer in respect of the uninsured balance. 1991, c.
### Chunk 2073

64, a. 2626; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 296. IV. — Mutual insurance 2627. Where two or more persons mutually agree to insure each other against marine losses there is said to be mutual insurance. Mutual insurance is governed by the provisions of this section except those relating to the premium but such arrangement as may be agreed upon may be substituted for the premium. 1991, c. 64, a. 2627; I. N. 20140501. V. — Direct action 2628. Articles 2500 to 2502 as to the direct action of injured third persons apply to marine insurance.
### Chunk 2074

Any stipulation that is inconsistent with those rules is null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2628; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 462 of 556 ### Page 463 CHAPTER XVI GAMING AND WAGERING 2629. Gaming and wagering contracts are valid in the cases expressly authorized by law. They are also valid where they are related to lawful activities and games requiring only skill or bodily exertion on the part of the parties, unless the amount at stake is immoderate given the circumstances and in view of the condition and means of the parties.
### Chunk 2075

1991, c. 64, a. 2629; I. N. 20140501. 2630. Where gaming and wagering are not expressly authorized by law, the winning party may not exact payment of the debt and the losing party may not recover the sum paid. The losing party may recover the sum paid, however, in cases of fraud or trickery, or where the losing party is a minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate or not endowed with reason. 1991, c. 64, a. 2630; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c.
### Chunk 2076

11, s. 97. CHAPTER XVII TRANSACTION 2631. Transaction is a contract by which the parties prevent a future contestation, put an end to a lawsuit or settle difficulties arising in the execution of a judgment, by way of mutual concessions or reservations. A transaction is indivisible as to its subject. 1991, c. 64, a. 2631; I. N. 20151101. 2632. No transaction may be made with respect to the status or capacity of persons or to other matters of public order. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2077

2632. 2633. A transaction has, between the parties, the authority of res judicata. A transaction is not subject to forced execution until it is homologated. 1991, c. 64, a. 2633; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 297. 2634. Error of law is not a cause for annulling a transaction. Apart from such exception, a transaction may be annulled for the same causes as contracts in general. 1991, c. 64, a. 2634; I. N. 20151101. 2635. A transaction based on a title that is null is also null, unless the parties have expressly referred to and covered the nullity.
### Chunk 2078

A transaction based on writings later found to be false is also null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2635. 2636. A transaction upon a lawsuit is null if the parties, or one of them, were unaware that a judgment having become final had terminated the litigation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2636; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 298. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 463 of 556 ### Page 464 2637. Where the parties have made a transaction on all matters between them, the subsequent discovery of documents of which they were unaware at the time of the transaction does not constitute a cause for annulling the transaction, unless the documents were withheld by one of the parties or, to his knowledge, by a third person.
### Chunk 2079

However, the transaction is null if it relates to only one subject and if the documents later discovered prove that one of the parties had no rights in it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2637; I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER XVIII ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS 2638. An arbitration agreement is a contract by which the parties undertake to submit a present or future dispute to the decision of one or more arbitrators, to the exclusion of the courts. 1991, c. 64, a. 2638. 2639. Disputes over the status and capacity of persons, family matters or other matters of public order may not be submitted to arbitration.
### Chunk 2080

An arbitration agreement may not be opposed on the ground that the rules applicable to settlement of the dispute are in the nature of rules of public order. 1991, c. 64, a. 2639. 2640. An arbitration agreement shall be evidenced in writing; it is deemed to be evidenced in writing if it is contained in an exchange of communications which attest to its existence or in an exchange of proceedings in which its existence is alleged by one party and is not contested by the other party. 1991, c.
### Chunk 2081

64, a. 2640. 2641. A stipulation which places one party in a privileged position with respect to the designation of the arbitrators is null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2641. 2642. An arbitration agreement contained in a contract is considered to be an agreement separate from the other clauses of the contract and where the arbitrators find the contract to be null, the arbitration agreement is not for that reason rendered null. 1991, c. 64, a. 2642; I. N. 20140501. 2643. Subject to the peremptory provisions of law, the arbitration procedure is governed by the contract or, failing that, by the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 464 of 556 ### Page 465 BOOK SIX PRIOR CLAIMS AND HYPOTHECS TITLE ONE COMMON PLEDGE OF CREDITORS 2644. The property of a debtor is charged with the performance of his obligations and is the common pledge of his creditors. 1991, c. 64, a. 2644. 2645. Any person under a personal obligation charges, for its performance, all his property, movable and immovable, present and future, except property which is exempt from seizure or property which is the subject of a division of patrimony permitted by law.
### Chunk 2083

However, the debtor may agree with his creditor to be bound to fulfil his obligation only from the property they designate. 1991, c. 64, a. 2645; I. N. 20140501. 2646. Creditors may institute judicial proceedings to cause the property of their debtor to be seized and sold. If the creditors claim together, the price is distributed proportionately to their claims, unless some of them have a legal cause of preference. 1991, c. 64, a. 2646; 2016, c. 4, s. 299. 2647. The legal causes of preference are prior claims and hypothecs.
### Chunk 2084

1991, c. 64, a. 2647; I. N. 20140501. 2648. Property which, under the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01), may be exempted or is exempt from seizure and falls within the limits specified by that Code cannot be seized. 1991, c. 64, a. 2648; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 797. 2649. A stipulation of unseizability is without effect, unless it is made in an act by gratuitous title and is temporary and justified by a serious and legitimate interest. Nevertheless, the property remains liable to seizure to the extent provided in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 2085

01). It may be set up against third persons only if it is published in the appropriate register. 1991, c. 64, a. 2649; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). TITLE TWO PRIOR CLAIMS 2650. A prior claim is a claim to which the law attaches the right for a creditor to be preferred over the other creditors, even the hypothecary creditors, according to the origin of his claim. The priority of a claim is indivisible. 1991, c. 64, a. 2650; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s.
### Chunk 2086

300. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 465 of 556 ### Page 466 2651. The following are the prior claims and, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, they are in all cases collocated in the order here set out: (1) legal costs and all expenses incurred in the common interest; (2) the claim of a seller who has not been paid the price of a movable sold to a natural person who does not operate an enterprise; (3) the claims of persons having the right to retain movable property, provided that the right subsists; (4) claims of the State for amounts due under fiscal laws; (5) claims of municipalities, school service centres and school boards for property taxes on taxable immovables as well as claims of municipalities, specially provided for by laws applicable to them, for taxes other than property taxes on immovables and movables for which the taxes are due.
### Chunk 2087

1991, c. 64, a. 2651; 1999, c. 90, s. 41; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 1, s. 172. 2652. Prior claims for legal costs and expenses incurred in the common interest may be enforced on movable or immovable property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2652; I. N. 20140501. 2653. Prior claims of the State for sums due under fiscal laws may be executed on movable property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2653. 2654. A creditor who proceeds by seizure in execution or who, as holder of a movable hypothec, has registered a prior notice of his intention to exercise his hypothecary rights, may request from the State that it declare the amount of its prior claim.
### Chunk 2088

The request shall be registered and proof of its notification shall be filed at the Personal and Movable Real Rights Registry Office. Within 30 days following the notification, the State shall declare the amount of its claim and enter it in the register of personal and movable real rights; such a declaration does not have the effect of limiting the priority of the State’s claim to the amount entered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2654; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 301; 2020, c. 17, s. 1.
### Chunk 2089

2654. 1. Prior claims of municipalities, school service centres and school boards for property taxes constitute a real right. They confer on the holder of the claims the right to follow the taxable property into whatever hands it may come. 1999, c. 90, s. 42; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 1, s. 173. 2655. Prior claims may be set up against other creditors, or against all third persons if they constitute a real right, without being published. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2090

2655; 1999, c. 90, s. 43. 2656. In addition to their personal or, as the case may be, real right of action and the provisional measures provided in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01), prior creditors may exercise their remedies under the law for the enforcement and realization of their prior claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2656; 1999, c. 90, s. 44; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 466 of 556 ### Page 467 2657.
### Chunk 2091

Prior claims rank, according to their order among themselves, and without regard to their date, before movable or immovable hypothecs. Prior claims of the same rank concur in proportion to the amount of each claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2657; I. N. 20140501. 2658. In a case of distribution or collocation among several prior creditors, the creditor of an indeterminate or unliquidated claim, or a claim suspended by a condition, is collocated according to his rank, but subject to the conditions prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 2092

01). 1991, c. 64, a. 2658; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 302. 2659. The priority granted by law to certain claims ceases by operation of law when the obligation which is its cause is extinguished. 1991, c. 64, a. 2659. TITLE THREE HYPOTHECS CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS DIVISION I NATURE OF HYPOTHECS 2660. A hypothec is a real right on movable or immovable property made liable for the performance of an obligation. It confers on the creditor the right to follow the property into whatever hands it may come, to take possession of it, to take it in payment, to sell it or to cause it to be sold and thus to have a preference upon the proceeds of the sale, according to the rank as determined in this Code.
### Chunk 2093

1991, c. 64, a. 2660; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2661. A hypothec is merely an accessory right, and is valid only as long as the obligation whose performance it secures subsists. 1991, c. 64, a. 2661; I. N. 20140501. 2662. A hypothec is indivisible and subsists in its entirety over all the charged property, over each item of that property and over every part of that property, even where the property or obligation is divisible. 1991, c. 64, a. 2662; I. N. 20140501; I.
### Chunk 2094

N. 20151101. 2663. A hypothec must be published in accordance with this Book or the Book on Publication of Rights so that the hypothecary rights it confers may be set up against third persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 2663; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION II KINDS OF HYPOTHEC 2664. Hypothecation takes place only under the conditions and in accordance with the forms authorized by law. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 467 of 556 ### Page 468 A hypothec may be conventional or legal.
### Chunk 2095

1991, c. 64, a. 2664; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 303. 2665. A hypothec is movable or immovable depending on whether it charges movable or immovable property or a universality of movable or immovable property. A movable hypothec may be created with or without delivery of the movable hypothecated. Where it is created with delivery, it may also be called a pledge. 1991, c. 64, a. 2665; I. N. 20151101. DIVISION III OBJECT AND EXTENT OF HYPOTHECS 2666. A hypothec is a charge on specific corporeal or incorporeal property, whether individual or multiple, or on all the property comprised in a universality.
### Chunk 2096

1991, c. 64, a. 2666; I. N. 20140501. 2667. A hypothec secures the capital, the interest accrued thereon and the costs, other than fees for professional services, legitimately incurred for their recovery or to conserve the charged property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2667; 2002, c. 19, s. 11; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 2668. A hypothec may not charge property exempt from seizure. Neither may a hypothec charge movable property belonging to a debtor which furnishes his principal residence and which is used by and is necessary for the life of the household.
### Chunk 2097

1991, c. 64, a. 2668; I. N. 20140501. 2669. A hypothec granted on the bare ownership does not extend to the full ownership upon extinction of the dismemberment of the right of ownership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2669. 2670. A hypothec on the property of another or on future property begins to charge it only once the grantor acquires title to the hypothecated right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2670; I. N. 20140501. 2671. A hypothec extends to everything united to the property by accession.
### Chunk 2098

1991, c. 64, a. 2671. 2672. Movables charged with a hypothec which are permanently physically attached or joined to an immovable without losing their individuality and without being incorporated with the immovable are considered, for the enforcement of the hypothec, to retain their movable character for as long as the hypothec subsists. 1991, c. 64, a. 2672; I. N. 20140501. 2673. A hypothec subsists on the new movable resulting from the transformation of property charged with a hypothec and extends to property resulting from the mixture or combination of several movables of which CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 468 of 556 ### Page 469 some are so charged.
### Chunk 2099

A person acquiring ownership of the new property, particularly through application of the rules on movable accession, is bound by such hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2673; I. N. 20140501. 2674. A hypothec that charges a universality of property subsists but attaches to property of the same nature which replaces property that has been alienated in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise. A hypothec that charges certain and determinate property so alienated attaches to the property that replaces it, by the registration of a notice identifying the new property.
### Chunk 2100

If no property replaces the alienated property, the hypothec subsists but attaches only to the sums of money which are proceeds of the alienation, provided they can be identified. 1991, c. 64, a. 2674; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 304. 2675. A hypothec that charges a universality of property subsists notwithstanding the loss of the hypothecated property where the debtor or the grantor replaces it within a reasonable time, having regard to the quantity and nature of the property.
### Chunk 2101

1991, c. 64, a. 2675; I. N. 20140501. 2676. A hypothec that charges a universality of claims does not extend to the subsequent claims of the person granting the hypothec when such claims result from the sale of his other property by a third person exercising his rights. Nor does it extend to a claim under an insurance contract on the other property of the grantor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2676; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. 2677. A hypothec on certain and determinate shares of the capital stock of a legal person subsists upon the shares or other securities received or issued on the purchase, redemption, conversion or cancellation or any other transformation of the hypothecated shares.
### Chunk 2102

Publication of the hypothec by registration subsists only if the registration is renewed against the shares or other securities received or issued. The creditor may not object to the transformation by reason of his hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2677; 2008, c. 20, s. 132; I. N. 20140501. 2678. Where what is owed to the creditor is the subject of a tender or deposit in accordance with this Code, the court may, following an application by the debtor making the tender or deposit, authorize attachment of the hypothec to the property tendered or deposited, and may allow the amount initially registered to be reduced.
### Chunk 2103

As soon as the reduction of the initial amount is entered in the appropriate register, the debtor is no longer entitled to withdraw his tender or the property deposited. 1991, c. 64, a. 2678; I. N. 20140501. 2679. A hypothec on an undivided share of property subsists if, by reason of partition or another act declaratory or attributive of ownership, the grantor or his successor retains rights in some part of the property, subject to the Book on Successions. If the grantor does not retain any rights in the property, the hypothec nevertheless subsists and attaches, according to its rank, to the transfer price payable to the grantor, to the payment resulting from the exercise of a right of withdrawal or a first refusal agreement, or to the equalizing sum payable to the grantor.

In the case of distribution or collocation among several hypothecary creditors, the creditor of an indeterminate or unliquidated claim, or a claim suspended by a condition, is collocated according to his rank, but subject to the conditions prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01). 1991, c. 64, a. 2680; I.

N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 305. CHAPTER II CONVENTIONAL HYPOTHECS DIVISION I THE GRANTOR OF A HYPOTHEC 2681. A conventional hypothec may be granted only by a person having the capacity to alienate the property hypothecated. It may be granted by the debtor of the obligation secured or by a third person. 1991, c. 64, a. 2681. 2682. A person whose right in property is conditional or subject to annulment may only grant a hypothec subject to the same condition or nullity.
### Chunk 2106

1991, c. 64, a. 2682; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2683. Except where he operates an enterprise and the hypothec is charged on the property of that enterprise, a natural person may grant a movable hypothec without delivery only on road vehicles or other movable property determined by regulation and subject to the conditions determined by regulation. Where the act constituting the hypothec is accessory to a consumer contract, it is subject to the rules on form and content prescribed by this Book or by regulation.

DIVISION II OBLIGATIONS SECURED BY HYPOTHECS 2687. A hypothec may be granted to secure any obligation whatever.
### Chunk 2111

1991, c. 64, a. 2687. 2688. A hypothec granted to secure payment of a sum of money is valid even if, when it is granted, the debtor has not received or has received only partially the prestation in consideration of which he has undertaken the obligation. This rule is applicable in particular to lines of credit and the issue of bonds or other titles of indebtedness. 1991, c. 64, a. 2688; I. N. 20140501. 2689. The act constituting a hypothec must indicate the specific sum for which it is granted.
### Chunk 2112

The same rule applies even where the hypothec is constituted to secure the performance of an obligation of which the value cannot be determined or is uncertain. 1991, c. 64, a. 2689; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2690. The sum for which the hypothec is granted is not considered to be indeterminate where the act, rather than stipulating a fixed rate of interest, contains the necessary particulars for determining the effective rate of interest on the sum. 1991, c. 64, a. 2690; I.
### Chunk 2113

N. 20140501. 2691. Where the creditor refuses to hand over the sums of money he has undertaken to lend and for which he holds a hypothec as security, the debtor or the grantor may, at the expense of the creditor, cause the hypothec to be reduced or cancelled, upon payment, in the latter case, of only the amounts that may then be due. 1991, c. 64, a. 2691. 2692. A hypothec securing the performance of obligations of a legal person, partnership or trustee may be granted in favour of the hypothecary representative for all present and future creditors of those obligations.
### Chunk 2114

The representative may be one of the creditors or the only creditor of the obligations, or a third person. The hypothecary representative is appointed by the debtor or grantor or by one of the creditors. The representative is the holder of the hypothec and has the power to exercise all the rights it grants, including that of releasing the hypothec and consenting to cancellation of its registration in the registers kept at the registry office; in exercising those rights, the representative binds the creditors towards third persons.
### Chunk 2115

The hypothecary representative is replaced, if necessary, under the conditions and subject to the terms specified in the hypothecary or other act that appoints the representative or, in the absence of such an act, as determined by the creditor or creditors. If the representative is replaced, the hypothec and other securities CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 471 of 556 ### Page 472 created in the representative’s favour subsist in favour of the representative’s successor.
### Chunk 2116

However, the latter may not exercise the rights relating to a hypothec published by registration until a notice of replacement expressly mentioning the name of the replaced representative is entered in the registers in which the hypothec was so published. Except in the case of a movable hypothec with delivery, a hypothec in favour of a hypothecary representative must, on pain of absolute nullity, be granted by notarial act en minute, regardless of the nature of the obligations whose performance it secures.
### Chunk 2117

1991, c. 64, a. 2692; 2015, c. 8, s. 358. DIVISION III IMMOVABLE HYPOTHECS 2693.

An immovable hypothec is valid only so far as the constituting act describes in a precise manner the hypothecated property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2694; I. N. 20140501. 2695. Hypothecs on the present and future rents produced by an immovable and hypothecs on the indemnities paid under the insurance contracts covering the rents are considered to be immovable hypothecs.
### Chunk 2118

Such hypothecs are published in the land register. 1991, c. 64, a. 2695. DIVISION IV MOVABLE HYPOTHECS § 1. — Movable hypothecs without delivery 2696. A movable hypothec without delivery shall, on pain of absolute nullity, be granted in writing. 1991, c. 64, a. 2696. 2697.

### Chunk 2119

1991, c. 64, a. 2697; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2698. A movable hypothec charging the fruits and products of the soil, and the materials and other things forming an integral part of an immovable, takes effect when they become movables with a separate existence. It ranks from its registration in the register of personal and movable real rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 2698; 2016, c. 4, s. 306. 2699. A movable hypothec that charges property represented by a bill of lading or other negotiable instrument or that charges claims may be set up against the creditors of the grantor from the time the creditor has performed his prestation, provided it is registered within the following 10 days.

A movable hypothec on property that is not alienated in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise and that is not registered in a file opened under the description of the property is preserved by filing a notice of preservation of hypothec in the register of personal and movable real rights. The notice must be registered within 15 days after the creditor is informed in writing of the transfer of the property and the name of the acquirer, or after he consents in writing to the transfer.
### Chunk 2121

The creditor transmits a copy of the notice to the acquirer within the same time. The notice must indicate the name of the debtor or grantor and of the acquirer and contain a description of the property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2700; 1998, c. 5, s. 10; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 308. 2701. A movable hypothec assumed by an acquirer may be published. 1991, c. 64, a. 2701; 2016, c. 4, s. 309. 2701. 1.

002) is deemed to be published by the sole fact of its constitution, and does not require registration. If the securities intermediary has constituted two or more movable hypothecs on the same securities or security entitlements, the hypothecs rank concurrently among themselves, regardless of when they were published. 2008, c. 20, s. 134. § 2. — Movable hypothecs with delivery 2702. A movable hypothec with delivery is granted by physical delivery of the property or title to the creditor or, if the property is already in his hands, by his continuing to physically hold it, with the grantor’s consent, to secure his claim.
### Chunk 2123

1991, c. 64, a. 2702; 2008, c. 20, s. 135. 2703. A movable hypothec with delivery is published by the creditor’s holding the property or title, and remains so only as long as he continues to hold it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2703. 2704. Holding is continuous even if its exercise is prevented by the act or omission of a third person without the consent of the creditor or is temporarily interrupted by the handing over of the property or title to the grantor or to a third person for evaluation, repair, transformation or improvement.
### Chunk 2124

1991, c. 64, a. 2704; 2016, c. 4, s. 310. 2705. The creditor, with the consent of the grantor, may hold the property through a third person, but if so, detention by the third person effects publication only from the time the third person receives evidence in writing of the hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2705. 2706. A creditor prevented from holding the property may revendicate it from the person holding it, unless he is prevented as a result of the exercise of hypothecary rights or a seizure in execution by another creditor.

A movable hypothec that charges a claim held by the grantor against a third person may be granted with or without delivery.
### Chunk 2127

In either case, however, the creditor may not enforce his hypothec against the debtors of hypothecated claims as long as it has not been set up against them in the same way as an assignment of claims. 1991, c. 64, a. 2710; I. N. 20140501. 2711. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 2711; I. N. 20140501; 2015, c. 8, s. 360. 2712.

1991, c. 64, a. 2712; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2713. In all cases, either the creditor or the grantor may institute an action to recover a hypothecated claim, provided he impleads the other. 1991, c. 64, a. 2713; I. N. 20140501. II. — Hypothecs with delivery on certain monetary claims 2015, c. 8, s. 361. 2713. 1. The requirement that the property be delivered to and held by the creditor in order for a movable hypothec with delivery on a monetary claim to be constituted and set up against third persons may, in the cases provided for in the provisions below, be met by the creditor obtaining control of that claim in accordance with those provisions.
### Chunk 2129

A monetary claim is any claim requiring the debtor to reimburse, return or restore an amount of money or make any other payment in respect of an amount of money, except (1) a claim represented by a negotiable instrument; CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 474 of 556 ### Page 475 (2) a claim that is a security or security entitlement within the meaning of the Act respecting the transfer of securities and the establishment of security entitlements (chapter T11.

A creditor may obtain control of a monetary claim that the grantor of the hypothec has against him or of a monetary claim that the grantor has against a third person. 2015, c. 8, s. 361. 2713. 3. A creditor obtains control of a monetary claim that the grantor of the hypothec has against him if the grantor has consented to the claim’s securing the performance of an obligation towards the creditor.
### Chunk 2131

2015, c. 8, s. 361. 2713. 4. A creditor obtains control of a monetary claim that the grantor of the hypothec has against a third person if (1) the claim relates to the credit balance of a financial account maintained by the third person for the grantor, or the claim relates to an amount of money transferred by the grantor to the third person to secure the performance of an obligation towards the creditor; and (2) the creditor has entered into an agreement, called a control agreement, with the third person and the grantor, under which the third person agrees to comply with the creditor’s instructions, without the additional consent of the grantor, as regards the credit balance or the amount of money.
### Chunk 2132

A creditor also obtains control of a monetary claim relating to the credit balance of a financial account if the creditor becomes the account holder. 2015, c. 8, s. 361; 2016, c. 4, s. 312. 2713. 5.

### Chunk 2135

Such a withdrawal is not subject to any notification or registration formality for publication purposes. 2015, c. 8, s. 361. 2713. 8. A movable hypothec with delivery effected by control of a monetary claim obtained by a creditor ranks ahead of any other movable hypothec encumbering that claim, from the time that control is obtained, regardless of when that other hypothec is published. If two or more movable hypothecs with delivery are granted on a monetary claim that the grantor has against a third person in favour of creditors each of whom has obtained control of the claim under a control agreement, the hypothecs rank among themselves according to when the third person agreed to comply with the creditor’s instructions.
### Chunk 2136

A hypothec granted on a monetary claim that the grantor has against the creditor ranks ahead of all other hypothecs with delivery effected by control encumbering that claim. However, if the claim relates to the credit balance of a financial account and another creditor has obtained control of the claim by becoming the account holder, that other creditor’s hypothec ranks ahead of the others. 2015, c. 8, s. 361. 2713. 9. A natural person who does not operate an enterprise may grant a movable hypothec with delivery effected by control of monetary claims only on those claims that the person may, under the prescribed conditions, encumber with a movable hypothec without delivery.

DIVISION V FLOATING HYPOTHECS 2715.
### Chunk 2144

A hypothec is a floating hypothec when some of the effects are suspended until, the debtor or grantor having defaulted, the creditor brings about crystallization of the hypothec by serving a notice of default and crystallization of the hypothec on the debtor or grantor. The floating character of the hypothec shall be expressly stipulated in the act. 1991, c. 64, a. 2715; I. N. 20140501. 2716. A floating hypothec has effect only if it was published beforehand and, if immovables are charged, only if it was registered against each of them.
### Chunk 2145

It may not be set up against third persons except by registration of the notice of crystallization. 1991, c. 64, a. 2716; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 477 of 556 ### Page 478 2717. Any condition or restriction stipulated in the constituting act as to the right of the grantor to alienate, hypothecate or dispose of the charged property has effect between the parties even before crystallization. 1991, c.
### Chunk 2146

64, a. 2717; I. N. 20140501. 2718. A floating hypothec on more than one claim has effect in respect of the debtors of hypothecated claims as soon as the notice of crystallization is registered, provided the notice is published in accordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01) for notification by public notice. The notice need not be published if the hypothec and the notice of crystallization have been set up against the debtors of the hypothecated claims in the same way as an assignment of claims.
### Chunk 2147

1991, c. 64, a. 2718; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 798. 2719. By crystallization, a floating hypothec has the effects of a movable or immovable hypothec with respect to whatever rights the grantor may have at that time in the charged property; if the property includes a universality, the hypothec also charges the property acquired by the grantor after crystallization. 1991, c. 64, a. 2719; I. N. 20140501. 2720. The sale of an enterprise by the grantor may not be set up against the holder of a floating hypothec.
### Chunk 2148

The same applies to a merger or reorganization of an enterprise. 1991, c. 64, a. 2720. 2721. A creditor holding a floating hypothec that charges a universality of property may, from registration of the notice of crystallization, take possession of the property to administer it in preference to any other creditor having published his hypothec after the date of registration of the floating hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2721; I. N. 20140501. 2722. Where there are several floating hypothecs on the same property, crystallization of one of them enables the creditors holding the others to register their own notice of crystallization at the registry office.
### Chunk 2149

1991, c. 64, a. 2722. 2723. Where the default of the debtor has been remedied, the creditor requires the registrar to cancel the notice of crystallization. The effects of crystallization cease with the cancellation, and the effects of the hypothec are again suspended. 1991, c. 64, a. 2723. CHAPTER III LEGAL HYPOTHECS 2724. Only the following claims may give rise to a legal hypothec: (1) claims of the State for sums due under fiscal laws, as well as certain other claims of the State or of legal persons established in the public interest, specially provided for in specific Acts; (2) claims of persons having taken part in the construction or renovation of an immovable; (3) the claim of a syndicate of coowners for payment of the common expenses; CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 478 of 556 ### Page 479 (4) claims under a judgment.
### Chunk 2150

1991, c. 64, a. 2724; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2019, c. 28, s. 68. 2725. The legal hypothecs of the State, including those for sums due under fiscal laws, and the hypothecs of legal persons established in the public interest may charge movable or immovable property. Such hypothecs take effect only from their registration in the appropriate register. Application for registration is made by filing a notice indicating the legislation granting the hypothec, the property of the debtor on which the creditor intends to enforce it, and stating the cause and the amount of the claim.
### Chunk 2151

The notice shall be served on the debtor. Registration by the State of a legal movable hypothec for sums due under fiscal laws does not prevent it from enforcing its prior claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2725; I. N. 20140501. 2726. A legal hypothec in favour of the persons having taken part in the construction or renovation of an immovable may not charge any other immovable. It exists only in favour of the architect, engineer, supplier of materials, workman and contractor or subcontractor for the work requested by the owner of the immovable, or for the materials or services supplied or prepared by them for the work.
### Chunk 2152

It is not necessary to publish a legal hypothec for it to exist. 1991, c. 64, a. 2726; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 313. 2727. A legal hypothec in favour of persons having taken part in the construction or renovation of an immovable subsists, even if it has not been published, for 30 days after the work has been completed. It subsists if, before the 30 days expire, a notice describing the charged immovable and indicating the amount of the claim is registered.
### Chunk 2153

The notice shall be served on the owner of the immovable. It is extinguished six months after the work is completed, unless, to preserve the hypothec, the creditor publishes an action against the owner of the immovable or registers a prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2727; I. N. 20140501. 2728. The hypothec secures the increase in value given to the immovable by the work, materials or services supplied or prepared for the work. However, where those in favour of whom it exists did not themselves enter into a contract with the owner, the hypothec is limited to the work, materials or services supplied after written notice of the contract to the owner.
### Chunk 2154

A workman is not bound to give notice of his contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2728; I. N. 20140501. 2729. The legal hypothec of a syndicate of coowners charges the fraction of the coowner who has defaulted for more than 30 days on payment of his common expenses, and has effect only from registration of a notice indicating the nature of the claim, the amount owing on the day the notice is registered, and the expected amount of charges and claims for the current financial year and the next two years.
### Chunk 2155

1991, c. 64, a. 2729; I. N. 20140501; 2019, c. 28, s. 69. 2730. Every creditor in whose favour a judgment awarding a sum of money has been rendered by a court having jurisdiction in Québec may acquire a legal hypothec on the movable or immovable property of his debtor. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 479 of 556 ### Page 480 He may acquire it by registering a notice describing the property charged with the hypothec and specifying the amount of the obligation, and, in the case of an annuity or support, the amount of the instalments and, where applicable, the basis of indexation.
### Chunk 2156

The notice must be served on the debtor. The notice must be filed with a copy of the judgment, unless the purpose of the notice is to acquire a legal hypothec on immovable property following a judgment rendered in a family matter. In that case, the notice must instead reproduce the pertinent extract from the operative part of the judgment and, as the case may be, the pertinent extract from the agreement or draft agreement to which the operative part refers. In addition, the accuracy of the content of the notice must be certified by a notary or an advocate.
### Chunk 2157

If the notice is notarial, the mere signature of the notary is sufficient certification. 1991, c. 64, a. 2730; 2000, c. 42, s. 5; 2016, c. 4, s. 314; 2020, c. 17, s. 2. 2731. Except in the case of the legal hypothec of the State or of a legal person established in the public interest, the court, on application of the owner of the property charged with a legal hypothec, may determine which property the hypothec may charge, reduce the number of properties or allow the applicant to substitute other security, sufficient to secure payment, for the hypothec; it may thereupon order cancellation of the registration of the legal hypothec.
### Chunk 2158

1991, c. 64, a. 2731; I. N. 20140501. 2732. A creditor who has registered his legal hypothec retains his right to follow it on movable property which is not alienated in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise, as though he were the holder of a conventional hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2732; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER IV CERTAIN EFFECTS OF HYPOTHECS DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISIONS 2733. A hypothec does not divest the grantor or the possessor, who continue to enjoy their rights over the charged property and may dispose of it, subject to the rights of the hypothecary creditor.
### Chunk 2159

1991, c. 64, a. 2733; I. N. 20140501. 2734. Neither the grantor nor his successor may destroy or deteriorate the hypothecated property or materially reduce its value except by normal use or in case of necessity. Where he suffers a loss, the creditor may, in addition to his other remedies, and even though his claim is neither liquid nor due, recover compensatory damages up to the amount of his claim and with the same right of hypothec; the amount so collected is imputed to his claim.
### Chunk 2160

1991, c. 64, a. 2734; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2735. Hypothecary creditors may institute judicial proceedings to have their hypothec recognized and interrupt prescription, even though their claims are neither liquid nor due. 1991, c. 64, a. 2735; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 315.

4, s. 316. 2736. The creditor of a movable hypothec with delivery shall do whatever is necessary to preserve the charged property he holds; he may not use it without the permission of the grantor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2736; I. N. 20140501. 2737. The fruits and revenues of the hypothecated property are collected by the creditor. Unless otherwise stipulated, the creditor hands over the fruits collected to the grantor, and imputes the revenues collected, first to expenses, then to any interest owing to him, and lastly to the capital of the debt.
### Chunk 2162

1991, c. 64, a. 2737; I. N. 20140501. 2738. Where shares of the capital stock of a legal person are redeemed for cash by the issuer, the creditor who receives the price imputes it as if it were revenue. 1991, c. 64, a. 2738; I. N. 20140501. 2739. The creditor is not liable for loss of the hypothecated property owing to superior force or as a result of its age, perishable nature, or normal and authorized use. 1991, c. 64, a. 2739; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s.

The grantor may not recover possession of the hypothecated property until performance of his obligation, unless the creditor abuses the property. A creditor bound by a judgment to return the property loses his hypothec. 1991, c. 64, a. 2741; I. N. 20140501. 2742. An heir of the debtor who has paid his share of the debt may not demand his share of the hypothecated property until the whole debt is paid.
### Chunk 2164

An heir of the creditor who receives his share of the debt may not return the hypothecated property to the prejudice of any unpaid coheir. 1991, c. 64, a. 2742; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION III RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CREDITORS HOLDING HYPOTHECATED CLAIMS 2743. A creditor holding a hypothec on a claim collects the revenues it produces, together with the capital falling due while the hypothec is in effect; he also gives an acquittance for the sums he collects. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 481 of 556 ### Page 482 Unless otherwise stipulated, he imputes the amounts collected to payment of the obligation, even if it is not yet due, in accordance with the general rules for payment.
### Chunk 2165

1991, c. 64, a. 2743; I. N. 20140501. 2744. The creditor may, in the act constituting the hypothec, authorize the grantor to collect repayments of capital or the revenues from the hypothecated claims as they fall due. 1991, c. 64, a. 2744. 2745. The creditor may at any time withdraw the authorization to collect that he gave to the grantor. To do so he shall notify the grantor and the debtor of the hypothecated rights that he will himself thenceforth collect the sums due.
### Chunk 2166

The withdrawal of authorization shall be registered. 1991, c. 64, a. 2745; 1998, c. 5, s. 11; I. N. 20140501. 2746. While the hypothec is in effect, the creditor is not bound to institute judicial proceedings to recover the capital or interest of the hypothecated rights, but he shall inform the grantor within a reasonable time of any irregularity in the payment of any sums due on the rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 2746; I. N. 20140501. 2747. The creditor remits to the grantor any sums collected over and above the obligation owed in capital, interest and costs, notwithstanding any stipulation by which, on whatever ground, the creditor may keep them.
### Chunk 2167

1991, c. 64, a. 2747; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER V EXERCISE OF HYPOTHECARY RIGHTS DIVISION I GENERAL PROVISION 2748. In addition to their personal right of action and the provisional measures provided in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25. 01), creditors may exercise only the hypothecary rights provided in this chapter for the enforcement and realization of their security. Thus, where their debtor is in default and their claim is liquid and due, they may exercise the following hypothecary rights: they may take possession of the charged property to administer it, take it in payment of their claim, cause it to be sold under judicial authority or sell it themselves.
### Chunk 2168

1991, c. 64, a. 2748; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). DIVISION II GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR THE EXERCISE OF HYPOTHECARY RIGHTS 2749. Creditors may not exercise their hypothecary rights before the period determined in article 2758 for surrender of the property has expired. 1991, c. 64, a. 2749; I. N. 20151101. 2750. Earlier ranking creditors take priority over later ranking creditors when exercising their hypothecary rights. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 482 of 556 ### Page 483 An earlier ranking creditor may, however, be bound to pay the costs incurred by a later ranking creditor if, after being notified of the exercise of a hypothecary right by the latter, he fails to invoke the priority of his rights within a reasonable time.
### Chunk 2169

1991, c. 64, a. 2750; I. N. 20140501. 2751. The creditor may exercise his hypothecary rights in whatever hands the property lies. 1991, c. 64, a. 2751; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2752. Where property charged with a hypothec subsequently is the subject of a usufruct, the hypothecary rights must be exercised against the bare owner and the usufructuary simultaneously, or notice must be given to the one against whom the rights were not exercised first. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2170

2752; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2753. A creditor whose hypothec charges more than one property may exercise his hypothecary rights simultaneously or successively against such property as he sees fit. 1991, c. 64, a. 2753; I. N. 20140501. 2754. Where later ranking creditors are secured by a hypothec enforceable on only one of the items of property charged in favour of the same creditor, that creditor’s hypothec is divided, if two or more of the items of property are sold under judicial authority and the proceeds to be distributed are sufficient to pay his claim, in proportion to what remains to be distributed out of the respective proceeds of the items of property.
### Chunk 2171

1991, c. 64, a. 2754; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2755. The holder of a floating hypothec may not exercise his hypothecary rights until after registration of the notice of crystallization. 1991, c. 64, a. 2755; I. N. 20140501. 2756. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 2756; 2008, c. 20, s. 137. DIVISION III PRELIMINARY MEASURES § 1. — Prior notice 2757. A creditor intending to exercise a hypothecary right must file a prior notice at the registry office, together with evidence that it has been served on the debtor and, where applicable, on the grantor and on any other person against whom he intends to exercise his right.
### Chunk 2172

The registration of the notice must be notified in accordance with the Book on Publication of Rights. 1991, c. 64, a. 2757; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 318. 2758. A prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right must disclose any failure by the debtor to perform his obligations, and contain a reminder, where applicable, that the debtor or a third person has the right to remedy the default. It must also disclose the amount of the claim in capital, and in interest, if any, and the nature of the hypothecary right which the creditor intends to exercise, furnish a description of the charged property, and demand from the person against whom the hypothecary right is to be exercised that he surrender the property before the expiry of the period specified in the notice.

### Chunk 2174

5, s. 12; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2759. A creditor holding a hypothec on securities or security entitlements within the meaning of the Act respecting the transfer of securities and the establishment of security entitlements (chapter T11. 002) may sell the securities or security entitlements or otherwise dispose of them without being required to give a prior notice, obtain their surrender or comply with the time limits prescribed by this Title, if the agreement between the creditor and the grantor so permits and, where the creditor does not have control of the securities or security entitlements, if they are, or are of a type, dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or financial markets.
### Chunk 2175

A creditor who so disposes of securities or security entitlements acts on behalf of the grantor and is not bound to declare the creditor’s quality to the acquirer. The creditor imputes the proceeds of the disposition to payment of the costs incurred to dispose of the securities or security entitlements, to payment of the claims that take precedence over the creditor’s rights and, finally, to payment of the creditor’s claim; the creditor remits any surplus to the grantor. The disposition purges the real rights to the extent provided by the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.
### Chunk 2176

01) in respect of the effect of a sale under judicial authority. The rules of this Title pertaining to a sale by a creditor are applicable in all other respects to the disposition of securities or security entitlements by a creditor, with the necessary modifications. 1991, c. 64, a. 2759; 2008, c. 20, s. 138; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 799; I. N. 20160101; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 319. 2760. The volontary alienation of property charged with a hypothec, effected after the creditor has registered a prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right, may not be set up against the creditor unless the acquirer, with the consent of the creditor, personally assumes the debt, or unless a sum sufficient to cover the amount of the debt, interest due and the costs incurred by the creditor is deposited.
### Chunk 2177

1991, c. 64, a. 2760; I. N. 20140501. § 2. — Rights of the debtor or person against whom a hypothecary right is exercised 2761. A debtor or a person against whom a hypothecary right is exercised, or any other interested person, may defeat exercise of the right by paying the creditor the amount owing to him or by remedying the omission or breach set forth in the prior notice and any subsequent omission or breach, and, in either case, by paying the costs incurred. This right may be exercised before the property is taken in payment or sold, or, if the right exercised is taking in possession, at any time.
### Chunk 2178

1991, c. 64, a. 2761; I. N. 20140501. 2762. A creditor having given prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right is not entitled to demand any indemnity from the debtor except the interest owing and the costs incurred. Notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, the costs incurred exclude professional fees payable by the creditor for services required by the creditor in order to recover the capital and interest secured by the hypothec or to preserve the charged property.

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 484 of 556 ### Page 485 § 3. — Surrender 2763. Surrender is voluntary or forced. 1991, c. 64, a. 2763. 2764. Surrender is voluntary where, before the period indicated in the prior notice expires, the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised abandons the property to the creditor in order that the creditor may take possession of it or consents in writing to turn it over to the creditor at an agreed time.
### Chunk 2180

If the hypothecary right exercised is taking in payment, voluntary surrender shall be recorded in an act made by the person surrendering the property and accepted by the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2764; 2000, c. 42, s. 6; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 320. 2765. Surrender is forced where the court orders it after ascertaining the existence of the claim, the debtor’s default, the refusal to surrender voluntarily and the absence of a valid cause for objection. The judgment fixes the period within which surrender shall be effected, determines the manner of effecting it and designates the person in whose favour it is carried out.
### Chunk 2181

1991, c. 64, a. 2765. 2766. If the good faith of the creditor or his capacity to administer or ability to sell the property for which he has applied for surrender is challenged, the court may order the creditor to furnish security to guarantee performance of his obligations. 1991, c. 64, a. 2766; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 321. 2767. Surrender is also forced where the court, upon application by the creditor, orders surrender of the property before the period indicated in the prior notice expires, where there is reason to fear that otherwise recovery of his claim may be endangered, or where the property may decline or depreciate rapidly.
### Chunk 2182

In the latter cases, the creditor is authorized to exercise his hypothecary rights immediately. The application need not be served on the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised, but the order shall be served on him. If the order is subsequently rescinded, the creditor is bound to return the property or pay back the price of alienation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2767; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 322. 2768. A creditor who has obtained surrender of the property has simple administration thereof until the hypothecary right he intends to exercise has in fact been exercised.
### Chunk 2183

1991, c. 64, a. 2768. 2769. A person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised and who is not liable for the debt becomes personally liable therefor if he fails to surrender the property within the time allotted by the judgment. 1991, c. 64, a. 2769; I. N. 20140501. 2770. Where a person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised has a prior claim by reason of his right to retain the movable property, he is bound to surrender it, subject to his priority. 1991, c.

### Chunk 2185

1991, c. 64, a. 2771; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2772. Real rights which a person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised had in the property when he acquired it, or that he extinguished while it was in his possession, revive after surrender unless they have been cancelled. 1991, c. 64, a. 2772; I. N. 20140501. DIVISION IV TAKING POSSESSION FOR PURPOSES OF ADMINISTRATION 2773. A creditor who holds a hypothec on the property of an enterprise may temporarily take possession of the hypothecated property and administer it or generally delegate its administration to a third person.
### Chunk 2186

The creditor or the person to whom he has delegated the administration acts in such a case as administrator of the property of others charged with full administration. 1991, c. 64, a. 2773; I. N. 20151101. 2774. The taking of possession of property does not affect the rights of the lessee. 1991, c. 64, a. 2774; I. N. 20140501. 2775. The taking of possession terminates when the claim of the creditor is satisfied in capital, interest and costs, when the exercise of his right is defeated, when he publishes a prior notice of the exercise of another hypothecary right, and under the same circumstances as the termination of the administration of the property of others.
### Chunk 2187

The bankruptcy of the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised does not terminate the taking of possession. 1991, c. 64, a. 2775; I. N. 20140501. 2776. When the possession ends, the creditor shall render account of his administration and, unless he has published a prior notice of the exercise of another hypothecary right, return the property in his possession to the person against whom the hypothecary right was exercised, or to his successors, at the place agreed on beforehand or, failing that, at the place where it is.
### Chunk 2188

He registers a notice of return of the property in the appropriate register. 1991, c. 64, a. 2776; I. N. 20140501. 2777.

### Chunk 2190

1991, c. 64, a. 2778; I. N. 20140501. 2779. Later ranking hypothecary creditors or the debtor may, within the time allotted for surrender, require the creditor to abandon the taking in payment and sell the property himself or cause it to be sold under judicial authority; they must first have registered a notice to that effect, reimbursed the creditor for the costs he has incurred and advanced the amounts needed for the sale of the property. The notice shall be served on the creditor, the grantor or the debtor, and the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised, and its registration is declared in accordance with the Book on Publication of Rights.
### Chunk 2191

Later ranking creditors who require the creditor to proceed with the sale shall also furnish him with security that the property will be sold at a price sufficient to ensure full payment of his claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2779; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2780. A creditor required to sell shall proceed to do so unless he prefers to pay the later ranking creditors who registered the notice, or, if the notice was registered by the debtor, unless the court authorizes the creditor to take the property in payment on such conditions as it determines.
### Chunk 2192

If the creditor does not act, the court may allow the person who registered the notice requiring the sale, or any other person it designates, to proceed with it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2780; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 323. 2781. Where the default has not been remedied or the payment has not been made in the time allotted for surrender, the creditor takes the property in payment by the effect of the judgment of surrender, or by an act voluntarily made by the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised, and accepted by the creditor, if neither the later ranking creditors nor the debtor required him to proceed with the sale.
### Chunk 2193

The judgment of surrender or the act voluntarily made and accepted constitutes the creditor’s title of ownership. 1991, c. 64, a. 2781; 2000, c. 42, s. 7; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2782. Taking in payment extinguishes the obligation. A creditor who has taken property in payment may not claim what he pays to a prior or hypothecary creditor whose claim is preferred to his. In such a case, he is not entitled to subrogation against his former debtor. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2194

2782. 2783. A creditor who has taken property in payment becomes the owner of it from the time of registration of the prior notice. He takes it as it then stood, but free of all hypothecs published after his. Real rights created after registration of the prior notice may not be set up against the creditor if he did not consent to them. 1991, c. 64, a. 2783; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501.

A creditor who holds a hypothec on the property of an enterprise and who has filed a prior notice at the registry office indicating his intention to sell the charged property himself may, after obtaining surrender of the property, proceed with the sale by agreement, by a call for tenders or by auction. 1991, c. 64, a. 2784; 2016, c. 4, s. 324. 2785. The creditor shall sell the property without unnecessary delay, at a commercially reasonable price, and in the best interest of the person against whom the hypothecary right is exercised.
### Chunk 2196

If there is more than one property, he may sell them together or separately. 1991, c. 64, a. 2785. 2786. A creditor who sells the property himself acts in the name of the owner and is bound to declare his quality to the acquirer at the time of the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 2786; I. N. 20140501. 2787. A creditor who proceeds by a call for tenders may do so by invitation or by a public call for tenders.

The creditor imputes the proceeds of the sale to payment of the costs of exercising the right, payment of the claims that take precedence over his rights, and, finally, payment of his claim. If other creditors have rights to assert, the creditor who sold the property renders account of the proceeds of the sale to the clerk of the competent court and remits what remains of the price after imputation; where no such creditors exist, he shall, within 10 days, render account of the proceeds of the sale to the owner of the property and remit any surplus to him; the rendering of account may be contested in the manner established in the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C25.

N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 326. 2790.

Hypothecs are extinguished by the loss of the charged property, a change in its nature, its withdrawal from commerce or its expropriation, where those events concern the property as a whole. 1991, c. 64, a. 2795; I. N. 20140501. 2796.

The court may also require that proof be made of such law; this may be done, among other means, by expert testimony or by the production of a certificate drawn up by a jurisconsult. Where such law has not been pleaded or its content has not been established, the court applies the law in force in Québec.

N. 20140501. 2816. In the event that the original of a document, entered in a register required to be kept by law and retained by the officer in charge of the register, is lost or is in the possession of the adverse party or of a third person without collusion on the part of the party invoking it, a copy of the document is also authentic if it is attested by the public officer who is its depositary or, if it has been deposited or filed in the Archives nationales, by the Keeper of the Archives nationales du Québec.

An extract which reproduces verbatim part of an authentic act is itself authentic if it is certified by the depositary of the act, provided the extract bears its date of issue and indicates the date, nature and place of execution of the original act and, where such is the case, the names of the parties and of the public officer who drew it up.
### Chunk 2216

1991, c. 64, a. 2817; I. N. 20140501. 2818. The recital, in an authentic act, of the facts which the public officer had the task of observing or recording makes proof against all persons. 1991, c. 64, a. 2818. 2819. To be authentic, a notarial act shall be signed by all the parties; it then makes proof against all persons of the juridical act which it sets forth and of those declarations of the parties which directly relate to the act. Where the parties are unable to sign, their declaration or consent shall be given before a witness who signs.
### Chunk 2217

Minors, persons of full age who are unable to give consent and persons who have an interest in the act may not be witnesses. 1991, c. 64, a. 2819. 2820. An authentic copy of a document makes proof against all persons of its conformity to the original and substitutes for it. An authentic extract makes proof of its conformity to the part of the document which it reproduces. 1991, c. 64, a. 2820; I. N. 20140501. 2821. Improbation is necessary only to contradict the recital in an authentic act of the facts which the public officer had the task of observing.
### Chunk 2218

DIVISION III SEMIAUTHENTIC ACTS 2822. An act purporting to be issued by a competent foreign public officer makes proof of its content against all persons and neither the quality nor the signature of the officer need be proved. Similarly, a copy of a document of which the foreign public officer is the depositary makes proof of its conformity to the original against all persons and substitutes for the original, if it purports to be issued by that officer.
### Chunk 2219

1991, c. 64, a. 2822; I. N. 20140501. 2823. A power of attorney under a private writing made outside Québec also makes proof against all persons where it is certified by a competent public officer who has verified the identity and signature of the mandator. 1991, c. 64, a. 2823. 2824. Acts, copies and powers of attorney mentioned in this section may be deposited with a notary, who may then issue copies of them.

N. 20140501. 2830. A private writing does not make proof of its date against third persons but that date may be established against them, by any means. However, acts executed in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise are presumed to have been made on the date they bear.

### Chunk 2224

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 494 of 556 ### Page 495 2833. A domestic paper stating that a payment has been received or containing a mention that the entry compensates for the lack of a title in favour of the person for whose benefit it sets forth an obligation makes proof against its author. 1991, c. 64, a. 2833; I. N. 20140501. 2834. A release, although unsigned and undated, inscribed by a creditor on the title of his debt or on a copy thereof which has always remained in his possession makes proof against him.
### Chunk 2225

The release is not admissible in proof of payment, however, if it has the effect of withdrawing the debt from the rules governing prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 2834. 2835. A person who invokes an unsigned writing shall prove that it originates from the person whom he claims to be its author. 1991, c. 64, a. 2835. 2836.

### Chunk 2226

32, s. 78. 2837. A writing is a means of proof whatever the medium, unless the use of a specific medium or technology is required by law. Where a writing is in a medium that is based on information technology, the writing is referred to as a technologybased document within the meaning of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1. 1). 1991, c. 64, a. 2837; 2001, c. 32, s. 78. 2838. In addition to meeting all other requirements of the law, the integrity of a copy of a statute, an authentic writing, a semiauthentic writing or a private writing drawn up in a medium based on information technology must be ensured for it to make proof in the same way as a writing of the same kind drawn up as a paperbased document.
### Chunk 2227

1991, c. 64, a. 2838; 2001, c. 32, s. 78; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 329. 2839. The integrity of a document is ensured if it is possible to verify that the information it contains has not been altered and has been maintained in its entirety, and that the medium used provides stability and the required perennity to the information. Where the medium or technology used does not allow the integrity of the document to be confirmed or denied, the document may, depending on the circumstances, be admitted as testimonial evidence or real evidence and serve as a commencement of proof.
### Chunk 2228

1991, c. 64, a. 2839; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; 2001, c. 32, s. 78; I. N. 20140501. 2840. It is not necessary to prove that the medium of a document or that the processes, systems or technology used to communicate by means of a document ensure its integrity, unless the person contesting the CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 495 of 556 ### Page 496 admission of the document establishes, upon a preponderance of evidence, that the integrity of the document has been affected.

A document may be reproduced either by generating a copy in the same medium or in a medium that is based on the same technology, or by transferring the information contained in the document to a medium based on different technology. Where it reproduces an original document or a technologybased document fulfilling the functions of an original as provided for in section 12 of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1.
### Chunk 2230

1), a copy, provided it is certified, or a document resulting from the transfer of information, provided it is documented, may legally stand in lieu of the reproduced document. In the case of a document in the possession of the State, a legal person, a partnership or an association, certification is effected by a person in authority or the person responsible for conserving the document. 1991, c. 64, a. 2841; 2001, c. 32, s. 78; I. N. 20140501. 2842. A certified copy is supported, if necessary, by a statement establishing the circumstances and the date of the reproduction, attesting that the copy contains the same information as the reproduced document and indicating the means used to ensure the integrity of the copy.
### Chunk 2231

The statement is made by the person responsible for document reproduction or by the person who reproduced the document. A document resulting from the transfer of information is supported, if necessary, by the documentation referred to in section 17 of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1. 1). 1991, c. 64, a. 2842; 2001, c. 32, s. 78. CHAPTER II TESTIMONY 2843. Testimony is a statement whereby a person relates facts of which he has personal knowledge or whereby an expert gives his opinion.
### Chunk 2232

To make proof, testimony shall be given by deposition in a judicial proceeding unless otherwise agreed by the parties or provided by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2843. 2844. Proof by testimony may be adduced by a single witness. A child who, in the opinion of the judge, does not understand the nature of an oath, may be permitted to testify without that formality, if the judge considers that the child is sufficiently mature to be able to relate the facts of which he had knowledge, and that he understands the duty to tell the truth.
### Chunk 2233

However, a judgment may not be based upon such testimony alone. 1991, c. 64, a. 2844; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 496 of 556 ### Page 497 2845. The probative force of testimony is left to the appraisal of the court. 1991, c. 64, a. 2845. CHAPTER III PRESUMPTIONS 2846. A presumption is an inference drawn by the law or the court from a known fact to an unknown fact. 1991, c. 64, a. 2846; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 2234

2847. A legal presumption is one that is specially attached by law to certain facts; it exempts the person in whose favour it exists from making any other proof. A presumption concerning presumed facts is simple and may be rebutted by proof to the contrary; a presumption concerning deemed facts is absolute and irrebuttable. 1991, c. 64, a. 2847. 2848. The authority of res judicata is an absolute presumption; it applies only to the object of the judgment when the demand is based on the same cause and is between the same parties acting in the same qualities and the thing applied for is the same.
### Chunk 2235

However, a judgment deciding a class action has the authority of res judicata with respect to the parties and the members of the group who have not excluded themselves therefrom. 1991, c. 64, a. 2848; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 330. 2849. Presumptions which are not established by law are left to the discretion of the court which shall take only serious, precise and concordant presumptions into consideration. 1991, c. 64, a. 2849. CHAPTER IV ADMISSIONS 2850. An admission is the acknowledgment of a fact which may produce legal consequences against the person who makes it.
### Chunk 2236

1991, c. 64, a. 2850. 2851. An admission may be express or implied. An admission cannot, however, arise from silence alone, except in the cases provided by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2851; I. N. 20140501. 2852. An admission made by a party to a dispute or by an authorized mandatary makes proof against the party if it is made in the proceeding in which it is invoked. It may not be revoked, unless it is proved to have been made through an error of fact. The probative force of any other admission is left to the appraisal of the court.

An admission may not be divided unless it contains facts which are foreign to the issue joined, the part of the admission objected to is implausible or contradicted by indications of bad faith or by contrary evidence, or the facts contained in the admission are unrelated to each other. 1991, c. 64, a. 2853; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s.

331. 2853. 1. An apology may not constitute an admission. Furthermore, it may not be admitted into evidence, affect the determination of fault or liability, interrupt prescription or cancel or reduce the insurance coverage to which the insured or a third person is entitled. Any express or implied expression of sympathy or regret constitutes an apology. 2020, c. 13, s. 1. CHAPTER V PRODUCTION OF REAL EVIDENCE 1991, c. 64, c. V; I. N. 20140501. 2854. The production of real evidence is a means of proof which allows the judge to make his own findings.
### Chunk 2239

Such real evidence may consist of an object, as well as the representation for the senses of an object, fact or place. 1991, c. 64, a. 2854; I. N. 20140501. 2855. The production of real evidence does not have probative force until its authenticity has been established by separate proof. However, where the real evidence produced is a technologybased document within the meaning of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1. 1), authenticity need only be established in cases to which the third paragraph of section 5 of that Act applies.

1991, c. 64, a. 2855; 2001, c. 32, s. 79; I. N. 20140501. 2856. The court may draw any inference it considers reasonable from the production of real evidence. 1991, c. 64, a. 2856; I. N. 20140501. TITLE THREE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE AND MEANS OF PROOF 1991, c. 64, Tit. III; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER I EVIDENCE 2857. Evidence of any fact relevant to a dispute is admissible and may be produced by any means. 1991, c. 64, a. 2857; I. N. 20140501. 2858.
### Chunk 2241

The court shall, even of its own motion, reject any evidence obtained under such circumstances that fundamental rights and freedoms are violated and whose use would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 498 of 556 ### Page 499 The latter criterion is not taken into account in the case of violation of the right of professional secrecy. 1991, c. 64, a. 2858; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II MEANS OF PROOF 1991, c.
### Chunk 2242

64, c. II; I. N. 20140501. 2859. The court may not of its own motion raise a ground of inadmissibility resulting from the provisions of this chapter where a party who is present or represented has failed to raise it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2859; I. N. 20140501. 2860. A juridical act set forth in a writing or the content of a writing shall be proved by the production of the original or a copy which legally stands in lieu of it. However, where a party acting in good faith and with diligence is unable to produce the original of a writing or a copy which legally stands in lieu of it, proof may be made by any means.
### Chunk 2243

In the case of technologybased documents, the functions of the original are fulfilled by a document meeting the requirements of section 12 of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1. 1) and the functions of the copy standing in lieu of the original are fulfilled by a certified copy of the document meeting the requirements of section 16 of that Act. 1991, c. 64, a. 2860; 2001, c. 32, s. 80; I. N. 20140501. 2861. Where a party has been unable, for a valid reason, to procure written proof of a juridical act, such an act may be proved by any means.
### Chunk 2244

1991, c. 64, a. 2861; I. N. 20140501. 2862. Proof of a juridical act may not be made, between the parties, by testimony where the value in dispute exceeds $1,500. However, in the absence of proof in writing and regardless of the value in dispute, proof may be made by testimony of any juridical act where there is a commencement of proof; proof may also be made by testimony, against a person, of a juridical act executed by him in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise. 1991, c.
### Chunk 2245

64, a. 2862; I. N. 20140501. 2863. The parties to a juridical act set forth in a writing may not contradict or vary the terms of the writing by testimony unless there is a commencement of proof. 1991, c. 64, a. 2863. 2864. Proof by testimony is admissible to interpret a writing, to complete a clearly incomplete writing or to impugn the validity of the juridical act which the writing sets forth. 1991, c. 64, a. 2864. 2865. A commencement of proof may arise from an admission or writing of the adverse party, his testimony or the production of real evidence, where it renders plausible the alleged fact.
### Chunk 2246

1991, c. 64, a. 2865; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 332. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 499 of 556 ### Page 500 2866. No evidence is admissible to rebut a legal presumption where, by reason of such presumption, the law annuls certain acts or disallows judicial proceedings, unless the law has reserved the right to make proof to the contrary. However, where the presumption is not of public order, it may be rebutted by an admission made in the proceeding in which the presumption is invoked.
### Chunk 2247

1991, c. 64, a. 2866; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 333. 2867. An admission made outside the proceeding in which it is invoked is proved by the means admissible as proof of the fact which is its subject. 1991, c. 64, a. 2867; I. N. 20151101. 2868. Proof by the production of real evidence is admissible in accordance with the relevant rules on admissibility as proof of the object, the fact or the place represented by it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2868; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 2248

CHAPTER III CERTAIN STATEMENTS 2869. A statement made by a person who does not testify in the judicial proceeding or made by a witness prior to the judicial proceeding is admissible as testimony if the parties consent thereto; a statement that meets the requirements of this chapter or of the law is also admissible as testimony. 1991, c. 64, a. 2869; I. N. 20140501. 2870. A statement made by a person who does not appear as a witness, concerning facts to which he could have legally testified, is admissible as testimony on application and after notice is given to the adverse party, provided the court authorizes it.
### Chunk 2249

The court shall, however, ascertain that it is impossible for the declarant to appear as a witness, or that it is unreasonable to require him to do so, and that the reliability of the statement is sufficiently guaranteed by the circumstances in which it is made. Reliability is presumed to be sufficiently guaranteed with respect in particular to documents drawn up in the ordinary course of business of an enterprise, to documents entered in a register required by law to be kept, and spontaneous statements that are contemporaneous to the occurrence of the facts.
### Chunk 2250

1991, c. 64, a. 2870; I. N. 20140501. 2871. Previous statements by a person who appears as a witness, concerning facts to which he may legally testify, are admissible as testimony if their reliability is sufficiently guaranteed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2871. 2872. Statements made in written form shall be proved by producing the writing. No other statement may be proved except by the testimony of the declarant or of the persons having had personal knowledge of it, unless otherwise provided in articles 2873 and 2874.
### Chunk 2251

1991, c. 64, a. 2872; I. N. 20140501. 2873. A statement recorded in writing by a person other than the declarant may be proved by producing the writing if the declarant has acknowledged that the writing faithfully reproduces his statement. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 500 of 556 ### Page 501 The same rule applies where the writing was drawn up at the request of the declarant or by a person acting in the performance of his duties, if there is reason to presume, having regard to the circumstances, that the writing faithfully reproduces the statement.
### Chunk 2252

1991, c. 64, a. 2873; I. N. 20140501. 2874. A statement recorded on magnetic tape or by any other reliable recording technique may be proved by such means, provided its authenticity is separately proved. However, where the recording is a technology based document within the meaning of the Act to establish a legal framework for information technology (chapter C1. 1), authenticity need only be established in cases to which the third paragraph of section 5 of that Act applies. 1991, c.
### Chunk 2253

64, a. 2874; 2001, c. 32, s. 81. BOOK EIGHT PRESCRIPTION TITLE ONE RULES GOVERNING PRESCRIPTION CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS 2875. Prescription is a means of acquiring or of being released by the lapse of time and according to the conditions determined by law: prescription is called acquisitive in the first case and extinctive in the second. 1991, c. 64, a. 2875; I. N. 20140501. 2876. That which is not an object of commerce, is nontransferable or is inappropriable, by reason of its nature or the purpose to which it has been appropriated, cannot be prescribed.
### Chunk 2254

1991, c. 64, a. 2876; I. N. 20140501. 2877. Prescription takes effect in favour of or against everyone, including the State, subject to express provision of law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2877; I. N. 20140501. 2878. The court may not, of its own motion, raise the plea of prescription. However, it shall, of its own motion, declare a remedy forfeit where so provided by law. Such forfeiture is never presumed; it results only where expressly provided for in a text. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2255

2878; I. N. 20140501. 2879. The period of time required for prescription is reckoned by full days. The day on which prescription begins to run is not counted in computing such period. Prescription is acquired only when the last day of the period has elapsed. Where the last day is a Saturday or a holiday, prescription is acquired only on the following working day. 1991, c. 64, a. 2879; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 2880. Dispossession determines the beginning of the period of acquisitive prescription.
### Chunk 2256

CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 501 of 556 ### Page 502 The day on which the right of action arises determines the beginning of the period of extinctive prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 2880; I. N. 20140501. 2881. Prescription may be pleaded at any stage of judicial proceedings, even in appeal, unless the party who has not pleaded prescription has, in light of the circumstances, demonstrated his intention of renouncing it. 1991, c. 64, a.
### Chunk 2257

2881. 2882. A ground of defence that may be raised to defeat an action may still be invoked, even if the time for using it by way of a direct action has expired, provided such ground could have constituted a valid defence to an action at the time when it could have served as the basis of a direct action. Acceptance of such a ground does not revive a direct action that is prescribed. 1991, c. 64, a. 2882; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II RENUNCIATION OF PRESCRIPTION 2883. Prescription may not be renounced in advance, but prescription acquired or the benefit of the time elapsed in the case of prescription that has begun to run may be renounced.
### Chunk 2258

1991, c. 64, a. 2883; I. N. 20140501. 2884. No prescriptive period other than that provided by law may be agreed upon. 1991, c. 64, a. 2884. 2885. Renunciation of prescription is either express or tacit; tacit renunciation results from an act or omission which implies the abandonment of the acquired right. However, renunciation of acquired prescription with respect to immovable real rights shall be published at the Land Registry Office. 1991, c. 64, a. 2885; I. N.
### Chunk 2259

20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 334; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. 2886. A person who may not alienate may not renounce acquired prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 2886; I. N. 20140501. 2887. Any person who has an interest in the acquisition of prescription may plead it, even if the debtor or the possessor renounces it. 1991, c. 64, a. 2887. 2888. Following renunciation, prescription begins to run again for the same period. 1991, c. 64, a. 2888. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 502 of 556 ### Page 503 CHAPTER III INTERRUPTION OF PRESCRIPTION 2889.
### Chunk 2260

Prescription may be interrupted naturally or civilly. 1991, c. 64, a. 2889. 2890. Acquisitive prescription is interrupted naturally where the possessor is deprived of the enjoyment of the property for more than one year. 1991, c. 64, a. 2890. 2891. Extinctive prescription is interrupted naturally where the holder of a right, having failed to avail himself of it, exercises that right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2891. 2892. The filing of a judicial application before the expiry of the prescriptive period constitutes a civil interruption, provided the demand is served on the person to be prevented from prescribing not later than 60 days following the expiry of the prescriptive period.
### Chunk 2261

Cross demands, interventions, seizures and oppositions are considered to be judicial applications. The notice expressing the intention by one party to submit a dispute to arbitration is also considered to be a judicial application, provided it describes the subject matter of the dispute to be submitted and is notified in accordance with the rules and time limits applicable to judicial applications. 1991, c. 64, a. 2892; I. N. 20151101; 2014, c. 1, s. 804. 2893. Any demand by a creditor to share in a distribution with other creditors also interrupts prescription.
### Chunk 2262

1991, c. 64, a. 2893; I. N. 20140501. 2894. Interruption does not occur if the demand is dismissed, or if the proceedings are discontinued or perempted. 1991, c. 64, a. 2894; I. N. 20140501. 2895. Where the demand of a party is dismissed without a decision having been made on the merits of the matter and where, on the date of the judgment, the prescriptive period has expired or will expire in less than three months, the demanding party has an additional period of three months from notification of the judgment in which to assert his right.
### Chunk 2263

The same applies to arbitration; the threemonth period then runs from the time the award is made, from the end of the arbitrators’ mandate, or from the notification of the judgment annulling the award. 1991, c. 64, a. 2895; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 2896. An interruption resulting from a judicial application continues until the judgment has become final or, as the case may be, until a transaction has intervened between the parties. The interruption has effect with regard to all the parties with respect to any right arising from the same source.
### Chunk 2264

1991, c. 64, a. 2896; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 335. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 503 of 556 ### Page 504 2897. An interruption which results from the bringing of a class action benefits all the members of the group who have not requested their exclusion from the group. 1991, c. 64, a. 2897. 2898. Acknowledgement of a right, as well as renunciation of the benefit of the time elapsed, interrupts prescription.
### Chunk 2265

1991, c. 64, a. 2898; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 2899. A judicial application or any other act of interruption against the principal debtor or against a surety interrupts prescription with regard to both. 1991, c. 64, a. 2899; I. N. 20151101. 2900. Interruption with regard to one of the creditors or debtors of a solidary or indivisible obligation has effect with regard to the others. 1991, c. 64, a. 2900. 2901. Interruption with regard to one of the joint creditors or debtors of a divisible obligation has no effect with regard to the others.
### Chunk 2266

1991, c. 64, a. 2901. 2902. Interruption with regard to one of the coheirs of a solidary creditor or debtor of a divisible obligation has effect, with regard to the other solidary creditors or debtors, only as regards the portion of that heir. 1991, c. 64, a. 2902. 2903. After its interruption, prescription begins to run again for the same period. 1991, c. 64, a. 2903; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER IV SUSPENSION OF PRESCRIPTION 2904. Prescription does not run against persons if it is impossible in fact for them to act by themselves or to be represented by others.
### Chunk 2267

1991, c. 64, a. 2904. 2905. Prescription does not run against a child yet unborn. Nor does it run against a minor or a person of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate with respect to remedies he may have against his representative or against the person entrusted with his custody, or with respect to remedies he may have against any person for bodily injury resulting from an act which could constitute a criminal offence. 1991, c. 64, a. 2905; 2013, c. 8, s. 6; 2020, c.

In force: 20250630 CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 504 of 556 ### Page 505 Similarly, parental union spouses do not prescribe against each other. 1991, c. 64, a. 2906; 2002, c. 6, s. 59; 2016, c. 4, s. 336; 2024, c. 22, s. 16. 2907. Prescription does not run against an heir with respect to his claims against the succession.
### Chunk 2269

1991, c. 64, a. 2907. 2908. An application for leave to bring a class action suspends prescription in favour of all the members of the group for whose benefit it is made or, as the case may be, in favour of the group described in the judgment granting the application. The suspension lasts until the application for leave is dismissed, the judgment granting the application for leave is set aside or the authorization granted by the judgment is declared lapsed; however, a member requesting to be excluded from the action or who is excluded therefrom by the description of the group made by the judgment on the application for leave, a judgment in the course of the proceeding or the judgment on the action ceases to benefit from the suspension of prescription.
### Chunk 2270

In the case of a judgment, however, prescription runs again only when the judgment is no longer susceptible of appeal. 1991, c. 64, a. 2908; 2014, c. 1, s. 805; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP); 2016, c. 4, s. 337. 2909. Suspension of prescription of solidary claims and indivisible claims produces its effects with respect to creditors and debtors and their heirs in accordance with the rules applicable to interruption of prescription of such claims. 1991, c. 64, a. 2909; I. N. 20140501.
### Chunk 2271

TITLE TWO ACQUISITIVE PRESCRIPTION CHAPTER I CONDITIONS OF ACQUISITIVE PRESCRIPTION 2910. Acquisitive prescription is a means of acquiring a right of ownership, or one of its dismemberments, through the effect of possession. 1991, c. 64, a. 2910. 2911. Acquisitive prescription requires possession conforming to the conditions set out in the Book on Property. 1991, c. 64, a. 2911; I. N. 20140501. 2912. A successor by particular title may join to his possession that of his predecessors in order to complete prescription.
### Chunk 2272

A successor by universal title or by general title continues the possession of his predecessor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2912. 2913. Detention cannot serve as the basis for prescription, even if it extends beyond the term agreed upon. 1991, c. 64, a. 2913; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 505 of 556 ### Page 506 2914. A precarious title may be interverted by a title originating from a third person or by an act performed by the holder which is incompatible with precarious holding.
### Chunk 2273

Interversion renders the possession effective for prescription, from the time the owner learns of the new title or of the act of the holder. 1991, c. 64, a. 2914; I. N. 20140501. 2915. Third persons may prescribe against the owner of property during its dismemberment or when it is held precariously. 1991, c. 64, a. 2915. 2916. The institute and his successors by universal title or by general title do not prescribe against the substitute before the opening of the substitution.
### Chunk 2274

1991, c. 64, a. 2916. CHAPTER II PERIODS OF ACQUISITIVE PRESCRIPTION 2917. The period for acquisitive prescription is 10 years, except as otherwise determined by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2917; I. N. 20140501. 2918. A person who has for 10 years possessed an immovable as its owner may acquire the ownership of it only upon a judicial application. 1991, c. 64, a. 2918; 2000, c. 42, s. 10; I. N. 20151101. 2919. The possessor in good faith of movable property acquires the ownership of it by three years running from the dispossession of the owner.
### Chunk 2275

Until the expiry of that period, the owner may revendicate the movable property, unless it has been acquired under judicial authority. 1991, c. 64, a. 2919. 2920. To prescribe, a subsequent acquirer need have been in good faith only at the time of the acquisition, even where his effective possession began only after that time. The same applies where there is joinder of possession, with respect to each previous acquirer. 1991, c. 64, a. 2920. TITLE THREE EXTINCTIVE PRESCRIPTION 2921.
### Chunk 2276

Extinctive prescription is a means of extinguishing a right owing to its nonuse or of pleading a peremptory exception to an action. 1991, c. 64, a. 2921; I. N. 20140501. 2922. The period for extinctive prescription is 10 years, except as otherwise determined by law. 1991, c. 64, a. 2922; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 506 of 556 ### Page 507 2923. Actions to enforce immovable real rights are prescribed by 10 years.
### Chunk 2277

However, an action to retain or obtain possession of an immovable may be brought only within one year of the disturbance or dispossession. 1991, c. 64, a. 2923; I. N. 20140501. 2924. A right resulting from a judgment is prescribed by 10 years if it is not exercised. 1991, c. 64, a. 2924. 2925. An action to enforce a personal right or movable real right is prescribed by three years, if the prescriptive period is not otherwise determined. 1991, c. 64, a. 2925; I. N.
### Chunk 2278

20140501. 2926. Where the right of action arises from moral, bodily or material injury appearing progressively or tardily, the period runs from the day the injury appears for the first time. 1991, c. 64, a. 2926; I. N. 20140501. 2926. 1. An action for damages for bodily injury resulting from an act which could constitute a criminal offence is prescribed by 10 years from the date the person who is a victim becomes aware that the injury suffered is attributable to that act. Nevertheless, such an action cannot be prescribed if the injury results from violent behaviour suffered during childhood, sexual violence or spousal violence.
### Chunk 2279

Conversion therapy, as defined by section 1 of the Act to protect persons from conversion therapy provided to change their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression (chapter P42. 2), constitutes violent behaviour suffered during childhood within the meaning of this article. However, an action against an heir, a legatee by particular title or a successor of the author of the act or against the liquidator of the author’s succession must, under pain of forfeiture, be instituted within three years after the author’s death, unless the defendant is sued for the defendant’s own fault or as a principal.
### Chunk 2280

Likewise, an action brought for injury suffered by the person who is a victim must, under pain of forfeiture, be instituted within three years after the death of the person who is a victim. 2013, c. 8, s. 7; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 13, s. 2; 2020, c. 28, s. 6; 2021, c. 13, s. 175; 2022, c. 22, s. 120. 2927. The prescriptive period for an action in nullity of contract runs from the day the person invoking the cause of nullity becomes aware of such cause or, in the case of violence or fear, from the day it ceases.
### Chunk 2281

1991, c. 64, a. 2927; I. N. 20140501. 2928. An application by a surviving spouse to have the compensatory allowance determined is prescribed by one year from the death of his spouse. 1991, c. 64, a. 2928; I. N. 20140501. 2929. An action for defamation is prescribed by one year from the day on which the defamed person learned of the defamation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2929. 2930. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, where an action is based on the obligation to make reparation for bodily injury caused to another, the requirement that notice be given prior to bringing the action or that the action be instituted within a period that is less than that provided for in this Book, cannot defeat a prescriptive period provided for in this Book.

In the case of a contract of successive performance, prescription runs with respect to payments due, even though the parties continue to perform one or another of their obligations under the contract. 1991, c. 64, a. 2931; I. N. 20140501. 2932. The prescriptive period for an action to reduce an obligation that is performed successively runs from the day the obligation becomes due, whether the obligation arises from a contract, the law or a judgment.
### Chunk 2283

1991, c. 64, a. 2932; I. N. 20140501. 2933.

The publication of rights is effected by their registration in the register of personal and movable real rights or in the land register, unless some other mode is expressly permitted by law.
### Chunk 2284

Registration benefits the persons whose rights are thereby published. 1991, c. 64, a. 2934. 2934. 1. The registration of rights in the land register is effected by indicating summarily the nature of the document presented to the Land Registrar and making a reference to the application pursuant to which registration is effected. The registration is valid only for the rights requiring or admissible for publication that are mentioned in the application, or where the application is in the form of a summary, in the accompanying document.
### Chunk 2285

2000, c. 42, s. 11; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. 2935. Any person, even a minor or a person under tutorship to a person of full age or under a protection mandate, may request the publication of a right, on his own behalf or on behalf of another. 1991, c. 64, a. 2935; 2020, c. 11, s. 99. 2936. Any renunciation or restriction of the right to publish a right which shall or may be published, as well as any penal clause relating thereto, is without effect. 1991, c. 64, a. 2936.
### Chunk 2286

2937. Publication of a right may be renewed at the request of any interested person. 1991, c. 64, a. 2937. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 508 of 556 ### Page 509 CHAPTER II RIGHTS REQUIRING OR ADMISSIBLE FOR PUBLICATION 2000, c. 42, s. 12. 2938. The acquisition, creation, recognition, modification, transmission or extinction of an immovable real right requires publication. Renunciation of a succession, legacy, community of property, partition of the value of acquests or of the family patrimony, and the judgment annulling renunciation, also require publication.
### Chunk 2287

Other personal rights and movable real rights require publication to the extent prescribed or expressly authorized by law. Modification or extinction of a published right shall also be published. 1991, c. 64, a. 2938. 2939. Restrictions on the right to dispose of property, other than purely personal restrictions, as well as rights of resolution, resiliation or eventual extinction of a right which shall or may be published, and any transfer or transmission of such rights, also shall or may be published.
### Chunk 2288

1991, c. 64, a. 2939; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 338. 2940. Transfers of authority over immovables between the governments of Québec and Canada may be published. Transfers of authority between the government of Canada or of Québec and legal persons established in the public interest may also be published. Registration of a transfer is obtained by filing a notice describing the immovable to be transferred and specifying the extent of the authority transferred, the term of the transfer and under which Act it is made.
### Chunk 2289

1991, c. 64, a. 2940; I. N. 20140501. TITLE TWO EFFECTS OF PUBLICATION CHAPTER I SETTING UP OF RIGHTS 2941. Publication of rights allows them to be set up against third persons, determines their rank and, where the law so provides, gives them effect. Rights produce their effects between the parties even if they are not published, unless the law expressly provides otherwise. 1991, c. 64, a. 2941; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 339. 2942. The publication of a right is renewed by notice, in the manner prescribed in the regulations under this Book; such renewal preserves the opposability of the right at its initial rank.
### Chunk 2290

1991, c. 64, a. 2942; I. N. 20140501. 2943. A right registered in a register in regard to property is presumed known to any person acquiring or publishing a right in the same property. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 509 of 556 ### Page 510 A person who does not consult the appropriate register and, in the case of a right registered in the land register, the application to which the registration refers, as well as the accompanying document if the application is in the form of a summary, may not invoke good faith to rebut the presumption.
### Chunk 2291

1991, c. 64, a. 2943; 2000, c. 42, s. 13; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 340. 2943. 1. The registration in the land register of a real right established by agreement or of an agreement concerning a real right takes effect only from the registration of the title of the grantor or last holder of the right. This rule does not apply where the right of the grantor or last holder was acquired without a title, in particular by natural accession, or where the title concerned is an original title of the State.
### Chunk 2292

2000, c. 42, s. 14. 2944. Registration of a right in the register of personal and movable real rights or the land register entails, as against all persons, a simple presumption of the existence of that right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2944; 2000, c. 42, s. 15; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER II RANKING OF RIGHTS 2945. Unless otherwise provided by law, rights rank according to the date, hour and minute entered on the memorial of presentation or, if the application concerning them is presented for registration in the land register, entered in the book of presentation, provided that the entries have been made in the appropriate registers.
### Chunk 2293

Where publication by delivery is authorized by law, rights rank according to the time at which the property or title is delivered to the creditor. 1991, c. 64, a. 2945; 2000, c. 42, s. 16; I. N. 20140501. 2946. Where two acquirers of an immovable hold their title from the same predecessor in title, the right is acquired by the acquirer who first publishes his right. 1991, c. 64, a. 2946. 2947. Where several registrations concerning the same property and rights of the same nature are requested at the same time, the rights rank concurrently.
### Chunk 2294

1991, c. 64, a. 2947. 2948. An immovable hypothec ranks only from registration of the grantor’s title, but after the seller’s hypothec created in the grantor’s act of acquisition. If several hypothecs have been registered before the grantor’s title, they rank in the order of their respective registrations. 1991, c. 64, a. 2948; I. N. 20140501. 2949. A hypothec charging a universality of immovables ranks, with respect to each immovable, only from the time of registration of the hypothec against each.
### Chunk 2295

Registration of a hypothec against immovables acquired subsequently is obtained by presenting a notice containing the description of the immovable acquired and a reference to the act constituting the hypothec, and setting forth the specific sum for which the hypothec was granted. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 510 of 556 ### Page 511 However, if the hypothec was not published in the land book for the registration division in which the immovable acquired subsequently is located, its registration is obtained by means of a summary of the act constituting the hypothec, containing the description of the acquired immovable.
### Chunk 2296

1991, c. 64, a. 2949; 2000, c. 42, s. 17; I. N. 20140501. 2950. A hypothec charging a universality of movables ranks, with respect to each movable included in the universality, only from registration thereof in the register, under the description of the grantor and under the indication of the nature of the universality. 1991, c. 64, a. 2950; I. N. 20140501. 2951. A hypothec that charged a movable subsequently incorporated into an immovable and that has become an immovable hypothec, may not be set up against third persons before its registration in the land register.
### Chunk 2297

Between the hypothec that charged the movable subsequently incorporated into the immovable and the immovable hypothec concerning that immovable, the first of the hypothecs to be registered in the land register has priority of rank. Registration in the land register of the hypothec that charged the movable is obtained by presenting a notice containing the description of the immovable concerned, a reference to the act constituting the hypothec and its registration in the register of personal and movable real rights, and setting forth the specific sum for which the hypothec was granted.
### Chunk 2298

1991, c. 64, a. 2951; I. N. 20140501. 2952. Legal hypothecs in favour of persons having taken part in the construction or renovation of an immovable are ranked before any other published hypothec, for the increase in value given to the immovable; such hypothecs rank concurrently among themselves, in proportion to the value of each claim. 1991, c. 64, a. 2952; I. N. 20140501. 2953. Hypothecs that charge movables that have been transformed, mixed or combined so as to form a new movable take the rank of the first hypothec published against any property having served to form the new movable, provided that the publication of the hypothec charging the movable that was transformed, mixed or combined has been renewed against the new movable; if that is the case, the hypothecs rank concurrently, in proportion to the value of each movable thus transformed, mixed or combined.
### Chunk 2299

1991, c. 64, a. 2953; 2002, c. 19, s. 15; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 341. 2954. A movable hypothec acquired on the movable of another or on a future movable ranks from the time of its publication but after the seller’s hypothec, if any, created in the grantor’s act of acquisition, provided that hypothec is published within 15 days after the sale. 1991, c. 64, a. 2954; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 341. 2955. Registration of the notice of crystallization determines the rank of a floating hypothec.
### Chunk 2300

If several floating hypothecs are the subject of notices of crystallization, they rank among themselves from their respective registrations, regardless of the registration of the notices of crystallization. 1991, c. 64, a. 2955. 2956. Cession of rank between hypothecary creditors shall be published. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 511 of 556 ### Page 512 Where it occurs, the rank of the creditors is interverted to the extent of their respective claims, but in such a manner as not to prejudice any intermediate creditors.
### Chunk 2301

1991, c. 64, a. 2956; I. N. 20140501. CHAPTER III OTHER EFFECTS 2957. Publication does not interrupt prescription. 1991, c. 64, a. 2957; 2000, c. 42, s. 18. 2958. Rights published after the registration of the notice of execution the minutes of the creditor’s seizure of an immovable may not be set up against that creditor, provided the seizure is followed by a sale under judicial authority. 1991, c. 64, a. 2958; 2014, c. 1, s. 806. 2959. Registration of a hypothec preserves, in favour of the creditor, the same rank for the interest due for the current year and the three preceding years as for the capital.
### Chunk 2302

Similarly, the registration of an annuity preserves, in favour of the annuitant, the same rank for the periodic payments for the current year and the arrears for the three preceding years as for the prestation. 1991, c. 64, a. 2959. 2960. The creditor or annuitant has a hypothec for the surplus of interest due or arrears of annuity only from the time of registration of a notice setting forth the amount claimed. However, interest due or arrears owing at the time of registration of the hypothec or annuity are preserved by the registration if the amount is stated in the application.
### Chunk 2303

1991, c. 64, a. 2960. 2961. Substitution has no effect with respect to property acquired in replacement of substituted property unless the substitution is mentioned in the act of acquisition and is published. Publication of the substitution does not affect the rights of third persons who have already published the rights they derive from the institute under an act by onerous title. 1991, c. 64, a. 2961; I. N. 20140501. 2961. 1. The registration of reservations of ownership or rights of redemption, or of any transfer thereof, where it concerns a universality composed of movable property that is of the same kind and that may be sold or transferred in the ordinary course of business between persons who operate enterprises, preserves all the rights of the seller or transferee not only in that property but also in any property of the same kind for which reservations of ownership, rights of redemption or transfers between those persons are granted subsequent to the registration.
### Chunk 2304

However, such reservations, rights or transfers may not be set up against a third person who acquires any such property in the ordinary course of business of the seller’s enterprise. The registration is effective for a period of 10 years; the period may be extended if the registration is renewed. These rules also apply to the registration of rights of ownership under leasing contracts and of rights under leases with a term of more than one year, or of any transfer thereof, where the registration concerns a CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 512 of 556 ### Page 513 universality composed of movable property that is of the same kind and that may be the subject of such contracts in the ordinary course of business between persons who operate enterprises.
### Chunk 2305

1998, c. 5, s. 13; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. CHAPTER IV PROTECTION OF THIRD PERSONS IN GOOD FAITH 2962. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 2962; 2000, c. 42, s. 19. 2963. Notice given or knowledge acquired of a right that has not been published never compensates for the absence of publication. 1991, c. 64, a. 2963; I. N. 20140501. 2964. Absence of publication may be set up by any interested person against any person, even a minor or a person under tutorship to a person of full age or under a protection mandate, and against the State.
### Chunk 2306

1991, c. 64, a. 2964; 2020, c. 11, s. 100. 2965. Every interested person may apply to the court, in cases of error, to obtain the correction or cancellation of a registered entry. 1991, c. 64, a. 2965. CHAPTER V ADVANCE REGISTRATION 2966. Any judicial application concerning a real right which shall or may be published in the land register may, by means of a notice, be the subject of an advance registration. A judicial application concerning a movable real right entered in the register of personal and movable real rights may also, by means of a notice, be the subject of an advance registration.
### Chunk 2307

1991, c. 64, a. 2966; I. N. 20151101. 2967. Where a person is, through no fault of his own, prevented from publishing a right arising from a will by reason of the concealment, destruction or contestation of the will or of any other obstacle, he may, to preserve that right, make an advance registration of the right he claims by presenting a notice within one year after the testator’s death. 1991, c. 64, a. 2967. 2968. Rights which are the subject of a judgment or transaction terminating an action are deemed published from the time of their advance registration, provided they are published within 30 days after the judgment becomes final or the transaction takes place.
### Chunk 2308

Rights under a will that was prevented from being published are also deemed published from the time of their advance registration, provided the will is published within 30 days after the obstacle has ceased or after the will is obtained or probated, and at the latest within three years from the opening of the succession. 1991, c. 64, a. 2968; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2016, c. 4, s. 342. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 513 of 556 ### Page 514 TITLE THREE MODALITIES OF PUBLICATION 2016, c.

### Chunk 2313

The index of names comprises all the entries that cannot be made in the index of immovables or the other registers kept by the Land Registrar. 1991, c. 64, a. 2972; 2000, c. 42, s. 24. 2972. 1. The index of immovables contains one land file for each immatriculated immovable on the cadastral plan for the registration division. 2000, c. 42, s. 24. 2972. 2. The register of real rights of State resource development contains one land file, opened under a serial number, for each such real right in the registration division the situs of which is not immatriculated.

N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 3025. Where required by the circumstances, the Land Registrar may change the business hours of the registry office or close the registry office temporarily. 1991, c. 64, a. 3025; 2000, c. 42, s. 59; 2020, c. 17, s. 19. TITLE FOUR IMMATRICULATION OF IMMOVABLES CHAPTER I CADASTRAL PLAN 3026. The immatriculation of an immovable consists in determining its relative position on a cadastral plan, indicating its boundaries, measurements and area and assigning a number to it.
### Chunk 2375

Immatriculation is completed by the identification of the owner, an indication of the mode of acquisition, the registration number of the title and, where applicable, the correspondence between the old and new cadastral numbers, or between the serial number of the file for the immovable, and the new cadastral number. 1991, c. 64, a. 3026; 2000, c. 42, s. 60; I. N. 20151101. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 526 of 556 ### Page 527 3027. The cadastral plan is drawn up according to law and forms part of the land register; it is presumed accurate.
### Chunk 2376

In the case of discrepancy between the boundaries, measurements and area shown on the plan and those mentioned in the documents presented, those on the plan are presumed accurate. 1991, c. 64, a. 3027; 2000, c. 42, s. 61; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 17, s. 20. 3028. The cadastral plan comes into force on the day the land file is opened in the land register. The opening of a land file shall be made, with all possible diligence, in the order of receipt of each cadastral plan.
### Chunk 2377

1991, c. 64, a. 3028; 2000, c. 42, s. 62; I. N. 20140501. 3028. 1. The publication of a hypothec on an immovable represented on a cadastral plan established pursuant to section 1 of the Cadastre Act (chapter C1) must, except if the hypothec has been entered in the land file opened under a serial number for that immovable, be renewed within two years following the opening of the land file in the index of immovables. If the publication is not renewed, the rights preserved by the initial registration have no effect with respect to other creditors or subsequent acquirers whose rights are duly published.
### Chunk 2378

2000, c. 42, s. 63; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 349. 3029. Every cadastral plan shall be submitted to the minister responsible for the cadastre, who, if satisfied that the plan is made according to law and is accurate, transmits a copy certified by him for deposit at the Land Registry Office; he also sends a copy to the office of the municipality where the immovable is situated. 1991, c. 64, a. 3029; 2000, c. 42, s. 64; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. 3030.
### Chunk 2379

Except where it pertains to an immovable situated in territory without a cadastral survey, no right of ownership may be published in the land register unless the immovable concerned is identified by a separate lot number on the cadastre. No declaration of coownership or of coemphyteusis may be registered unless the immovable is the subject of a cadastral plan that contains the immatriculation of the private and common portions. 1991, c. 64, a. 3030; I. N. 20140501. 3031. The situs of a real right of State resource development which the law declares to be property separate from the land to which the right pertains, such as a mining right, or the situs of a railway network or a network of cable communications, water or gas distribution, power lines, petroleum products pipelines or sewage conduits may be immatriculated.
### Chunk 2380

However, connections between a network and the immovables served by it are not shown on the cadastral plan. 1991, c. 64, a. 3031; 1995, c. 33, s. 31; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 350. 3032. From the day a cadastral plan comes into force, the number assigned to a lot is its sole description and is sufficient in any document referring to the lot. Where the right which is to be published pertains to an immovable composed of several whole lots, each lot shall be individually described.
### Chunk 2381

1991, c. 64, a. 3032; I. N. 20140501. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 527 of 556 ### Page 528 3033. From the day a cadastral plan comes into force, any person who draws up an act which shall or may be published is bound to describe immovables by the number assigned to them on the cadastral plan. Failing such description, the application for registration of a right shall be refused, unless a notice containing the description of the immovable is presented, with the act itself or an extract or summary thereof, in accordance with the rules established in this Book.
### Chunk 2382

The cadastral notice for registration of the right shall be made in the manner prescribed in the regulations made under this Book. 1991, c. 64, a. 3033; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 3034. When, on an application from the owner of an immovable situated in a territory without a cadastral survey or of a network or the holder of a real right of State resource development, a land file is opened under a serial number, that number is the sole description of the immovable to which the file applies, and is sufficient in any document making reference thereto.
### Chunk 2383

After the file is opened, any person who draws up an act which shall or may be published is bound to describe the immovable to which the file applies by the number assigned to it, and to indicate that the immovable corresponds, wholly or in part, to the immovable for which the file was opened. If this indication does not appear in the application, the registration shall be refused. 1991, c. 64, a. 3034; 2000, c. 42, s. 65; I. N. 20140501. 3035. In no case may the registrar accept an application concerning an immovable situated in territory without a cadastral survey, or a network or a real right of State resource development, if the application does not contain the description of the land file concerned or is not accompanied by a notice making reference to the file, except where the application includes or is accompanied by an application for the opening of a file.
### Chunk 2384

No application for the opening of a file is necessary, if the application concerning the immovable, network or right does not evidence any real right established by agreement or any agreement relating to a real right; however, until a land file is opened, registration may only be effected in the index of names. A real right of State resource development cannot give rise to the opening of a land file under a serial number unless ownership of the right is declared by law to be separate from ownership of the land subject to the right.
### Chunk 2385

1991, c. 64, a. 3035; 2000, c. 42, s. 66; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 351. 3036. In territory without a cadastral survey and also in territory with a cadastral survey if permitted by law, an immovable shall be described by metes and bounds and by its measurements; an indication of the elements useful for locating the relative position of the immovable and a statement that no land file exists, shall also be included in the description. The description of an immovable by reference to the original survey or by means of geographic coordinates or plane rectangular coordinates is nevertheless admissible in a territory without a cadastral survey, provided that the description, which must also state that no land file exists, allows the immovable to be properly identified and its relative position to be properly located.
### Chunk 2386

Where the description of an immovable by reference to the original survey refers to parts of lots, it must be completed by a description by metes and bounds and the measurements of each of those parts. 1991, c. 64, a. 3036; 2002, c. 19, s. 14. 3037. Where an immovable consists of parts of several lots, each part of a lot shall be described by metes and bounds and its measurements. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 528 of 556 ### Page 529 The description of a part of lot as the remainder after separation of other parts of the lot, or by reference to the names of the owners of its adjoining properties, is not admissible.
### Chunk 2387

1991, c. 64, a. 3037. 3038. The description of a railway network, or a network of cable communications, water or gas distribution, power lines, petroleum products pipelines or sewage conduits includes, in addition to an indication of its general nature, (1) if the network is immatriculated, the cadastral number assigned to it; (2) if the network is not immatriculated, the description of the cadastres traversed by it or, in territory without a cadastral survey, a description sufficient to identify it, unless a land file has been opened for the network.
### Chunk 2388

In an application for the opening of a land file for a network which is not immatriculated, a description shall be given of the cadastres or territory served by it. 1991, c. 64, a. 3038; 1995, c. 33, s. 32; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 352. 3039. The situs of a real right of State resource development which has been immatriculated is described by the immatriculation number assigned to it. That number and the indication of the nature of the right are sufficient in any document which refers to it.
### Chunk 2389

The assignment of an immatriculation number includes the description of the immovables on which the real right of State resource development is exercised, in order that the relevant correspondences be entered in the land register. 1991, c. 64, a. 3039; I. N. 20140501. 3040. The situs of a real right of State resource development which is not immatriculated is described by the mention of the nature of the right and a description of the place where it is exercised, unless a land file has been opened for the situs of the right in question.
### Chunk 2390

The number of the land files of the immovables on which the right is exercised shall be included in the application for the opening of the land file of that right, so that the relevant correspondences may be entered in the land register, either in the index of immovables or in the register of public service networks and immovables situated in territory without a cadastral survey; the right may be set up against third persons only from the time the relevant correspondences are entered in the register.
### Chunk 2391

1991, c. 64, a. 3040; 2000, c. 42, s. 68; I. N. 20140501. 3041. The immatriculation of the private and common portions of a vertical divided coownership may not take place before the foundation and main walls of the building in which they are situated allow measurement of their limits. 1991, c. 64, a. 3041; I. N. 20140501. 3042. A person authorized to expropriate shall, in territory with a cadastral survey, submit to the minister responsible for the cadastre a plan, approved by that person for the owner, in order that the required part and the remainder be immatriculated; the approval, signed by the expropriating party, is received en minute by a land surveyor and refers to the minute number of the plan.
### Chunk 2392

In addition, in the case of a plan involving a renumbering, the expropriating party shall give notice of the deposit to every person having caused his address to be registered, but the consent of the creditors and the beneficiary under a declaration of family residence is not required to obtain the new cadastral numbering. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 529 of 556 ### Page 530 No transfer under the Act respecting expropriation (chapter E25) nor cession of the required part of the lot may be registered before the plan comes into force.
### Chunk 2393

The first paragraph also applies to municipalities authorized by law to appropriate for public utility, without formality or indemnity, a right of ownership in superficies as to the surface or the subsoil of an immovable. 1991, c. 64, a. 3042; 2000, c. 42, s. 69; 2010, c. 4, s. 2; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 353; 2023, c. 27, s. 240. CHAPTER II AMENDMENTS TO THE CADASTRE 3043. Any person may submit a plan, approved by him, to the minister responsible for the cadastre in order to amend the plan of a lot he owns or in which he has acquired a right of ownership otherwise than by agreement; the approval, signed by the owner, is received en minute by a land surveyor and refers to the minute number of the plan concerned.
### Chunk 2394

The owner may also request the numbering of a lot, the striking out or replacement of the existing numbering or obtain a new numbering. The acceptance by the minister of a plan the purpose of which is to amend the plan of a lot in which a right of ownership has been acquired by a person otherwise than by agreement compensates for the absence of the approval of any other person having rights in the lot represented on the plan. The minister may also, in case of error, correct a plan or change the number of a lot, supply any omitted number or strike out or replace the existing numbering.
### Chunk 2395

He shall in such a case notify the amendment to the owner registered in the land register and to any person having caused his address to be registered. Such notification includes reasons and is accompanied by extracts from the old and the new cadastral plans. Upon the parcelling of a lot, the parts resulting therefrom shall be immatriculated simultaneously. 1991, c. 64, a. 3043; 2000, c. 42, s. 70; 2010, c. 4, s. 3; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 3044. The consent of the hypothecary creditors and of the beneficiary under a declaration of family residence is required for the owner to obtain a cadastral amendment involving a renumbering.
### Chunk 2396

The consent is given by notarial act en minute, and shall be published. 1991, c. 64, a. 3044; 2000, c. 42, s. 71; 2010, c. 4, s. 4; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 354. 3045. The Land Registrar indicates in the register, under the number of the lot concerned, the nature of any amendment made to the plan which does not affect the cadastral number. When opening a land file required by a cadastral renumbering, the Registrar establishes, where applicable, according to the information on the plan, the correspondence between the old lot number or the old serial number of the land file and the new lot number.
### Chunk 2397

Rights set forth in an application evidencing the acquisition of a part of a lot may not be registered in the land register until a cadastral amendment assigns (1) a separate cadastral number to the acquired part and to the remainder; or (2) a separate cadastral number, where the acquired part is amalgamated with a contiguous lot, to the immovable resulting from the amalgamation and to the immovable resulting from the parcelling.

Cancellation arises from an entry made in the appropriate register to strike an earlier registration. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 531 of 556 ### Page 532 To cancel a registration in the land register, the entry is made in the register of mentions.
### Chunk 2400

1991, c. 64, a. 3057; 2000, c. 42, s. 76; I. N. 20140501. 3057. 1. Unless otherwise provided by law, cancellation is obtained by presenting an application made in accordance with the rules applicable to the land register or the register of personal and movable real rights. However, applications for cancellation of a registration in the land register may be presented in the form of a summary only in the cases determined by law. Cancellation is voluntary or, failing that, judicial; it may also be legal.
### Chunk 2401

2000, c. 42, s. 76. 3057. 2. Cancellation arising from an entry in the register of mentions must be noted in the land register, except in the index of names. 2000, c. 42, s. 76. 3058. Where the law or the application for registration sets the date after which the registration ceases to have effect, the registration expires by operation of law at midnight on the expiry date of the period fixed by law or the application and, where applicable, entered in the register, if the registration has not been renewed before that time.
### Chunk 2402

1991, c. 64, a. 3058; 2000, c. 42, s. 77; I. N. 20140501. 3059. The registration of a right is cancelled with the consent of the holder or beneficiary of the right. Nevertheless, the registration in the land register of a hypothec or of a restriction on the right to dispose of property, or of any other right with a fixed term, which has expired because the date after which it ceases to have effect has passed, or the registration of a hypothec which is extinguished by the lapse of the time prescribed by law, may be cancelled on presentation of an application made by any interested person; the registration in the register of personal and movable real rights of a hypothec, or of such a restriction or right which, according to the register, has expired, or the registration of an address that no longer has effect, may be cancelled by the registrar on his own initiative.
### Chunk 2403

The cancellation of a registration in the register of personal and movable real rights must give reasons and be dated. 1991, c. 64, a. 3059; 2000, c. 42, s. 78; I. N. 20140501. 3060. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 3060; 2000, c. 42, s. 79. 3061. The registration of the legal hypothec of persons having participated in the construction or renovation of an immovable is cancelled, on the application of any interested person, where, within six months after the later of the date of registration and the date of completion of the work, no action has been brought and published or no prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right has been published; the application must state the reasons for the cancellation and be presented with proof that it was served upon the creditors at least 10 days before its presentation to the Land Registrar.
### Chunk 2404

The registration of the legal hypothec of a syndicate of coowners on a fraction of the coownership is cancelled, on the application of any interested person, upon the expiry of three years after its date, unless an action has previously been brought and published. However, where an action has been brought and published, cancellation is obtained by registering the judgment dismissing the action or ordering the cancellation, or by filing a certificate of the clerk of the court attesting that the action has been discontinued.
### Chunk 2405

1991, c. 64, a. 3061; 2000, c. 42, s. 80; I. N. 20140501; 2020, c. 17, s. 27. CIVIL CODE Updated to November 1 2024 © Québec Official Publisher CCQ1991 / 532 of 556 ### Page 533 3062. Registration of a declaration of family residence is cancelled, on the application of any interested person, only in the following cases: where the married or civil union spouses consent, where one of the spouses has died and his succession has been liquidated, where the spouses are separated from bed and board or are divorced, where the civil union has been dissolved, the marriage or civil union has been annulled, or where the immovable has been alienated with the consent of the spouses or with the authorization of the court.
### Chunk 2406

Except where the spouses consent to the cancellation and where the application is based on a judgment, the application shall be accompanied, as the case may be, by a death certificate and a certified declaration of the liquidation of the succession or a copy of the joint notarial declaration of dissolution. An application that is based on a judgment is made by presenting a notice reproducing the pertinent extract from the operative part of the judgment. The accuracy of the content of the notice must be certified by a notary or an advocate.
### Chunk 2407

If the notice is notarial, the mere signature of the notary is sufficient certification. 1991, c. 64, a. 3062; 2002, c. 6, s. 62; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101; 2020, c. 17, s. 23. 3063. The court may order the cancellation of a registration effected without right or irregularly, or on the basis of a title that is null or that is irregular as to form or where the registered right has been annulled, resolved, resiliated or extinguished by prescription or otherwise. Cancellation is also ordered where the immovable against which a declaration of family residence had been registered has ceased to be used for that purpose.
### Chunk 2408

1991, c. 64, a. 3063; I. N. 20140501; 2016, c. 4, s. 355. 3064. (Repealed). 1991, c. 64, a. 3064; 2000, c. 42, s. 81. 3065. Total acquittance of a claim entails consent to cancellation. Partial acquittance entails consent to only an equivalent reduction. The creditor is bound to register the acquittance if he receives a sufficient amount to pay the registration fee and the costs of sending the application to the registry office; he may not claim any other amount, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.
### Chunk 2409

1991, c. 64, a. 3065; I. N. 20140501. 3066. Reduction of a hypothec securing a claim to be paid with a sum of money deposited for that purpose is made by registering the judgment declaring the tender to be valid and specifying, where applicable, the person entitled to the sum of money deposited, or by registering the judgment authorizing, at the debtor’s request, the reduction of the hypothec and its transfer onto the property tendered or deposited. 1991, c. 64, a. 3066. CHAPTER II CERTAIN CASES OF CANCELLATION 3066.
### Chunk 2410

1. Registration of the address of a coowner in indivision may be cancelled on the application of any interested person. It may also be cancelled on the registrar’s own initiative if the registrar becomes aware that the undivided coownership has ended.

A notice of advance registration of rights arising from a will is cancelled upon the application of any interested person, if the will was not published within three years of the date of opening of the succession.
### Chunk 2412

The application must be accompanied by the act of death of the testator. 2000, c. 42, s. 82; I. N. 20140501; I. N. 20151101. 3067. Registration of a right ending at death or of a hypothec securing it may not be cancelled without the consent of the holder or beneficiary; after his death, the person requiring the cancellation shall present the act of death and an affidavit as to the identity of the deceased. 1991, c. 64, a. 3067; I. N. 20160101 (NCCP). 3068. Registration of a hypothec in favour of the State is cancelled or reduced by filing a certificate of the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General of Québec, or of a person designated by the Attorney General, stating that the hypothec is extinguished or reduced.
### Chunk 2413

It is also cancelled or reduced by filing a certificate of the Minister of Revenue, or a person designated by the Minister of Revenue, stating that the hypothec is extinguished or reduced, if the hypothec was created by virtue of an Act under the administration of that Minister. It may further be cancelled or reduced by filing a copy of an order of the Government, certified by the clerk of the Executive Council. 1991, c. 64, a. 3068; 2010, c. 31, s. 81; 2016, c. 4, s. 356. 3069.
### Chunk 2414

Registration of rights extinguished by the exercise of hypothecary rights, by sale under judicial authority or by definitive sale of the property for failure to pay property taxes is cancelled following registration of the sale or of the taking in payment. All registrations of, as applicable, notices of execution minutes of seizure, notices and prior notices of sale, notices of intention to pursue a remedy or the exercise of a right and notices requiring abandonment of the taking in payment under the Book on Prior Claims and Hypothecs are thereupon cancelled by the registrar.
### Chunk 2415

Where the sale is not proceeded with, registration of notices of execution minutes of seizure and notices is cancelled only upon the filing of a certificate evidencing that fact issued by bailiff, by the person designated to conduct the sale or, if applicable, by the court clerk. Applications for cancellation in the land register of the registrations referred to in this article may be in the form of a summary of the document. 1991, c. 64, a. 3069; 1992, c. 57, s. 716; 2000, c. 42, s.

83; I. N. 20140501; 2014, c. 1, s. 810. 3070. Registration of the prior notice of sale for nonpayment of property taxes and of the adjudication is cancelled following the registration of the definitive sale made by the municipal or school authority or by the act evidencing the redemption of the immovable. Registration of the prior notice of sale for nonpayment of property taxes is also cancelled following the production of the list of immovables that have not been sold.
