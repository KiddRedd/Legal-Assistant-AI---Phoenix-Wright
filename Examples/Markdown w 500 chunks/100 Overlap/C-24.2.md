This Code governs the use of vehicles on public highways and, in specified cases, on certain private roads and lands, and pedestrian, cyclist and other road user traffic on public highways.
### Chunk 14

It establishes the rules relating to highway safety, to the registration of road vehicles, to licences and permits which are under the administration of the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec, and to the control of highway transportation of persons and goods. The provisions of this Code regarding the registration and identification of a vehicle by means of a number affixed to it apply to the vehicles referred to in the Act respecting offhighway vehicles (chapter V1. 3). The rules set out by this Code to ensure safe vehicular traffic are also applicable to offhighway vehicles and maintenance vehicles governed by the Act respecting offhighway vehicles when such vehicles travel in those areas where the Code applies, taking into account the specific equipment and vehicle specifications, and with the other necessary modifications.
### Chunk 15

In areas where this Code applies, if one of its provisions is inconsistent with a provision of the Act respecting offhighway vehicles, the more restrictive provisions to ensure public safety prevail. In particular, the lowest speed limits prevail. 1986, c. 91, s. 1; 1990, c. 19, s. 11; 1990, c. 83, s. 1; 1996, c. 56, s. 1; 1996, c. 60, s. 69; 2014, c. 12, s. 42; 2018, c. 7, s. 2; 2020, c. 26, s. 128. 2.

### Chunk 16

They also apply to every person who leases a road vehicle for a period of not less than one year. 1986, c. 91, s. 2. 3.

All road users have a duty, especially toward more vulnerable users, to be careful and considerate when travelling on a public highway. Drivers of road vehicles have a duty to show extra care for more vulnerable users such as pedestrians, cyclists, mobility impaired persons and persons who, in the performance of their duties, work on foot on a public highway.
### Chunk 17

Vulnerable users, for their part, have a duty to adopt behaviours that enhance their own safety. 2018, c. 7, s. 3; 2024, c. 10, s. 43. 4.
