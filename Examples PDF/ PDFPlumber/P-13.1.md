police patrolling is a prerequisite for basic training in the remaining two areas of police work.
Advanced training is training designed to upgrade skills or develop a specialized skill in a given area of
police work.
In-service training covers all activities designed to facilitate the integration of a police officer into the
police force to which the officer belongs and to allow the officer to perform police work within the force in as
harmonious and functional a manner as possible.

DIVISION II
POLICE FORCE TRAINING PLANS
3. The director of a police force must establish a professional training plan.

(1) update the knowledge and skills of police officers in the type of police work to which they are
assigned, in particular through the establishment of a personal training record for each police officer;
(2) propose career paths for police officers on the basis of their interests and the needs of the police force
and, more specifically, plan continued basic training leading to police investigation or police management
functions;

SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ORGANIZATION OF POLICE SERVICES
2001, c. 19, s. 12.
353.1. Local municipalities having a population of less than 50,000 inhabitants that do not form part of a

Every municipality that had its own police force may continue to be served by that police force to the
extent that the police force provides level 1 services at the latest on 1 June 2002. In such a case, the
agreements requiring the municipality to provide police services to other municipalities shall be maintained,
subject to the right of each municipality so served to withdraw from the agreement and be served by the

henceforth served by the Sûreté du Québec, the agreements are terminated by operation of law.
Police services intermunicipal boards shall be maintained, subject to a unanimous decision of the parties to
the contrary. Where an intermunicipal board is dissolved, every service agreement entered into between the
intermunicipal board and municipalities that are not party to the agreement establishing the intermunicipal
board is terminated by operation of law. Where an intermunicipal board is to continue to exist, any such
service agreement is maintained, subject to the right of each municipality so served to withdraw from the
agreement and be served by the Sûreté du Québec. Where one of the municipalities party to the agreement
establishing the intermunicipal board wishes to be served by the Sûreté du Québec, the municipality must
obtain the consent of the other municipalities party to that agreement.

at least one of the municipalities was, on 21 June 2001, served by a municipal police force, agree to share, in
accordance with the terms and conditions provided for in section 71, the services of the same police force.
Such police force will, at the latest on 1 June 2002, be required to provide the services of the level prescribed
by section 70. The Minister may, however, subject to the conditions the Minister determines, allow that only
some of the municipalities forming part of the same census agglomeration share the services of a single police
force.
The municipalities that elect to be served by a municipal police force must establish, in an organization
plan, that the police force will meet the conditions set out above. The plan must be submitted to the Minister
for approval within 30 days from publication in the Gazette officielle du Québec of the regulation replacing
Schedule I to the Regulation respecting the amount payable by the municipalities for the services of the Sûreté
du Québec, enacted by Order in Council 326-92 (1992, G.O. 2, 1115). Every municipality that fails to do so is
deemed to have elected to be served by the Sûreté du Québec.

353.2. The municipalities that are to be served by a municipal police force pursuant to sections 71 and 72
must submit to the Minister for approval, at the latest on 1 January 2002, a police service organization plan
stating, in particular, that the services of the required level will be provided at the latest on 1 June 2002.
However, if a municipality resulting from a municipal merger and referred to in the first paragraph of section
71 has a population of 100,000 or more on 1 June 2002, the municipality will not be required to submit such a
plan before 1 July 2002 and the services of the required level will not be required to be provided before 1
January 2003. In both cases, if a municipality fails to meet the requirements, the Minister may establish the
terms and conditions according to which the police services are to be shared by the municipalities concerned.
2001, c. 19, s. 12.
353.3. A police officer who is the holder of a permanent position or holds a managerial position within a
municipal police force that is abolished because the services in the territory served by the officer are to be
provided by the Sûreté du Québec becomes a member of the Sûreté du Québec, subject to the police officer

ensure that the body that administers a pension plan, other than a defined contribution plan, of which a person
referred to in section 353.3 or 353.7 is a member has entered into, with the Commission administrative des
régimes de retraite et d’assurances, a general agreement for the transfer of the person’s rights under the plan to
the Pension Plan of the members of the Sûreté du Québec, the Government and Public Employees Retirement
Plan or another pension plan applicable to employees of the State. The Commission may enter into such an
agreement with the authorization of the Government.
The conditions set out in such an agreement apply to the group constituted by the persons who are referred
to in the first paragraph and who come under the same employer, subject to their individual right to opt for
another plan in accordance with section 98 of the Supplemental Pension Plans Act (chapter R-15.1).
2001, c. 19, s. 12.
