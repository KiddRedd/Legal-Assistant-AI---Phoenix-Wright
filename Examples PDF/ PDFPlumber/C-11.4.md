CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
CHAPTER I
CONSTITUTION OF THE MUNICIPALITY
1. A city is hereby constituted under the name “Ville de Montréal”.
Montréal is a French-speaking city.
Montréal is the metropolis of Québec and one of its key actors as regards economic development.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 1; 2008, c. 19, s. 2.
2. The city is a legal person.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 2.
3. The territory of the city is the territory described in Schedule A.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 3.
4. Subject to any other provision of this Act or of any order of the Government made under section 9, the
city is a municipality governed by the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C‐19).
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 4.
5. The city succeeds to the rights, obligations and charges of the Communauté urbaine de Montréal and to
those of the following municipalities as they existed on 31 December 2001 : Ville d’Anjou, Ville de Baie-
d’Urfé, Ville de Beaconsfield, Cité de Côte-Saint-Luc, Ville de Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Cité de Dorval, Ville
de Hampstead, Ville de Kirkland, Ville de Lachine, Ville de LaSalle, Ville de L’Île-Bizard, Ville de L’Île-
Dorval, Ville de Montréal, Ville de Montréal-Est, Ville de Montréal-Nord, Ville de Montréal-Ouest, Ville de
Mont-Royal, Ville d’Outremont, Ville de Pierrefonds, Ville de Pointe-Claire, Ville de Roxboro, Ville de
Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Ville de Sainte-Geneviève, Ville de Saint-Laurent, Ville de Saint-Léonard, Village
de Senneville, Ville de Verdun and Ville de Westmount.
The city becomes, without continuance of suit, a party to every suit, in the place of the urban community
or, as the case may be, of every municipality to which the city succeeds.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 5; 2001, c. 25, s. 236.
6. The by-laws, resolutions, minutes, assessment roll, collection roll and other acts of each of the
municipalities that are consistent with the provisions of this Act and of any order of the Government made
under section 9 shall remain in force in the territory for which they were made until their objects are attained
or until they are replaced or repealed in accordance with this Act. They are deemed to be acts of the city or,
according to the field of jurisdiction to which they relate, of the borough council within which that territory is
situated.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 6; 2001, c. 25, s. 237.
7. The officers and employees of the Communauté urbaine de Montréal and of the municipalities referred

they were members prior to the constitution of the city.
The officers and employees of the Communauté urbaine de Montréal who, on 31 December 2001, exercise
their functions within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Community as regards land use planning or powers
of the Community transferred to the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal on 1 January 2002, may be
reassigned to the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal by any order of the Government made under
section 9.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
No officer or employee to whom this section applies, other than an officer or employee having entered into
employment with the urban community or any of the municipalities after 15 November 2000 may be laid off
or dismissed solely by reason of the constitution of the city.
2000, c. 56, Sch. I, s. 7.
8. The expenditures related to any debt of a municipality referred to in section 5 shall continue to be
financed by revenues derived exclusively from the territory of the municipality or a part thereof. Any surplus
of such municipality shall remain for the exclusive benefit of the inhabitants and ratepayers in its territory or a
part thereof. To determine if the financing or surplus should burden or be credited to just a part of the
territory, the rules applicable on 31 December 2001 respecting the financing of expenditures related to the
debt or the source of the revenues that have generated the surplus shall be considered.
Where expenditures related to a debt of a municipality referred to in section 5, for the 2001 fiscal year,
were not financed by the use of a specific source of revenue, the city may continue to finance them by using
revenues not reserved for other purposes that come from the territory of the municipality. Notwithstanding
section 6, the foregoing also applies where those expenditures were financed, for that fiscal year, by the use of
revenues from a tax levied for that purpose on all taxable immovables situated in that territory.
If it avails itself of the power provided for in the second paragraph in respect of a debt, the city may not, to
establish the tax burden provided for in section 150.1, charge to the revenues derived from the taxation
specific to the non-residential sector that come from the territory a percentage of the financing of the
expenditures related to that debt greater than the percentage corresponding to the quotient obtained by
dividing the total of those revenues by the total revenues provided for in section 8.6 and coming from that
territory. If the tax burden is established for the 2002 fiscal year or a subsequent fiscal year, the revenues of
the preceding fiscal year shall be considered for that division.
For the purposes of the third paragraph, the revenues of a fiscal year are those provided for in the budget
adopted for that fiscal year. However, where a statement comparing the revenues provided for in the budget
and those which, according to later forecasts, will be the revenues of the fiscal year shows the necessity to
update budgetary forecasts, the updated forecasts shall be considered, provided that the statement is filed
before the city adopts the budget for the following fiscal year. If several statements are filed successively, the
last one shall be considered.
For the purposes of the third paragraph, “revenues derived from the taxation specific to the non-residential
sector” means the aggregate of the following:
(1) revenues from the business tax;
(2) (subparagraph repealed);
(3) revenues from the general property tax that are not considered in establishing the aggregate taxation
rate when, under section 244.29 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), several rates for that
tax are fixed;
(4) (a) revenues from the tax provided for in section 101 of Schedule C, where the occupants of
residential immovables are, under the third paragraph of that section, exempt from the payment of that tax or
where the tax is levied in accordance with the sixth paragraph of that section;
(b) (subparagraph repealed); and
(5) revenues from the amount in lieu of a tax referred to in any of subparagraphs 1 to 4 that must be paid
either by the Government, in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation, by the Government in accordance with section 254 and the first paragraph of section 255
of that Act, or by the Crown in right of Canada or one of its mandataries, except, if the amount stands in lieu
of the general property tax, revenues that would be considered in establishing the aggregate taxation rate if it
was the tax itself.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
Are deemed to constitute expenditures related to a debt of a municipality referred to in section 5 and
financed by revenues derived from its entire territory the amounts required after 31 December 2001, in
relation to a sum determined pursuant to subparagraph 4 of the second paragraph of section 137 of the
Supplemental Pension Plans Act (chapter R-15.1) in respect of a pension plan to which that municipality was
a party or in relation to the amortization of any unfunded actuarial liability of such a plan. The foregoing also
applies to the contributions paid after 31 December 2001, in relation to the obligations arising from a pension
plan not subject to the Supplemental Pension Plans Act to which a municipality referred to in section 5 was a
party, in respect of years of past service before 1 January 2002.
The date of the determination of a sum pursuant to subparagraph 4 of the second paragraph of section 137
of the Supplemental Pension Plans Act or of an unfunded actuarial liability provided for in the sixth
paragraph must be earlier than 21 June 2001. In addition, in the case of an improvement unfunded actuarial
liability, the amendment must have been made before 1 January 2002. However, if a pension plan still has
such a sum or unfunded actuarial liability on the date of its division, merger or termination, the contributions
paid by the city for that purpose after that date are deemed to be paid in respect of any sum or the
amortization of any liability to which the sixth paragraph refers.
Are deemed to constitute a surplus or expenditures related to a debt of a municipality referred to in section
5, respectively, the revenues or costs in relation to legal proceedings or a dispute to which such a municipality
or, as the case may be, the city is a party in respect of an event prior to 1 January 2002 that concerns the
municipality. The expenditures necessary to make up the negative balance of the assets of Corporation Anjou
80, as established at 31 December 2001, are deemed to be expenditures relating to a debt of Ville d’Anjou and
financed by revenues derived from the whole territory of Ville d’Anjou. The proceeds from the alienation of
Parc de l’Île-Notre-Dame pursuant to the city contract entered into in 2003 between Ville de Montréal and the
Government are deemed to constitute a surplus of Ville de Montréal as it existed on 31 December 2001.

53.
8.1. Every intermunicipal agreement, other than the agreement referred to in section 203, providing for the
establishment of an intermunicipal management board composed exclusively of municipalities referred to in
section 5 shall terminate on 31 December 2001, notwithstanding any inconsistent provision mentioned in the
agreement.
Notwithstanding sections 468.48 and 468.49 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19), an intermunicipal
management board referred to in the first paragraph shall cease its activities and is dissolved on the date set
out in that paragraph.
2001, c. 25, s. 239.
8.2. The city succeeds to the rights, obligations and charges of a management board referred to in section
8.1. In such a case, the second paragraph of section 5 and sections 6 and 8 apply, with the necessary
modifications and, in the case of section 8, as regards the debts, having regard to the apportionment
determined by the agreement establishing the management board in respect of capital expenditures.
2001, c. 25, s. 239.
8.3. In the case of an intermunicipal agreement providing for the establishment of an intermunicipal
management board composed in part of municipalities referred to in section 5, the city may request the
Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy to terminate the agreement on a date other than
the date provided for in the agreement to enable the management board to be dissolved. If the Minister
accepts the request, sections 468.48 and 468.49 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19) apply, with the
necessary modifications, from the date a copy of the Minister’s acceptance is transmitted to the intermunicipal
management board and the municipalities that are members thereof.

Section 8 applies in respect of the debts arising from an agreement referred to in the first paragraph, having
regard to the apportionment determined by the agreement establishing the management board in respect of
capital expenditures.
2001, c. 25, s. 239; 2003, c. 19, s. 250; 2005, c. 28, s. 196; 2009, c. 26, s. 109.
8.4. An intermunicipal agreement providing for a mode of operation other than an intermunicipal
management board and entered into exclusively by municipalities referred to in section 5 shall terminate on
31 December 2001. Such an agreement entered into between such a municipality and another municipality
shall terminate on 31 December 2002, except in the case of an agreement under Division II of Chapter II of
the Act respecting municipal courts (chapter C-72.01). Section 8 applies to the debts arising from such an
agreement, having regard to the apportionment determined by the agreement in respect of capital
expenditures.

8.5. The sums derived from the operation or leasing by the city of an industrial immovable, after deduction
of related administration and maintenance costs, or from the alienation of the immovable, must be used to
discharge the engagements made in respect of the immovable by any municipality referred to in section 5.
If the industrial immovable referred to in the first paragraph was the subject of an agreement under section
13.1 of the Act respecting municipal industrial immovables (chapter I-0.1) which provided for terms and
conditions relating to the apportionment of expenditures among the municipalities, the discharge pursuant to
the first paragraph of the engagements made must be consistent with those terms and conditions as regards
any part of the territory of the city that corresponds to the territory of any such municipality.
2001, c. 25, s. 239; O.C. 1308-2001, s. 2.

establishing the aggregate taxation rate of the city;
(2) the revenues derived from any special tax imposed on all the immovables in the territory of the city on
the basis of their taxable value;
(3) the revenues derived from any amount in lieu of a tax referred to in subparagraph 1 or 2 that must be
paid by the Government in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1) or the first paragraph of sections 254 and 255 of that Act or by the Crown
in right of Canada or by one of its mandataries, except, in the case where the amount is in lieu of the general
property tax, the revenues that would be covered by the exception provided for in subparagraph 1 if it were
the tax itself;
(4) the revenues derived from the source provided for in section 244.1 of the Act respecting municipal
taxation and considered in establishing the aggregate taxation rate of the city, except revenues that, under
section 244.9 of that Act, are used specifically to finance expenditures related to debts;
(5) the revenues derived from the business tax and any other tax imposed on the basis of the rental value
of an immovable;
(6) the revenues covered by the exception under subparagraph 1 or 3;
(7) the revenues derived from any amount in lieu of a tax, other than an amount referred to in
subparagraph 3, that must be paid by the Government in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
89.1. Notwithstanding the third paragraph of section 123 of the Act respecting land use planning and
development (chapter A-19.1), the by-law adopted by the city council under section 89 is not subject to
approval by referendum, except, subject to the fourth paragraph, where applicable, in the case of a by-law
authorizing the carrying out of a project referred to in subparagraph 5 of the first paragraph of that section.
The draft version of a by-law referred to in the first paragraph of section 89 must be submitted to public
consultation conducted by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal, which for that purpose must hold
public hearings and report on the consultation in a report in which it may make recommendations.
The public consultation under the second paragraph replaces the public consultation provided for in
sections 125 to 127 of the Act respecting land use planning and development. In the case of a by-law subject
to approval by referendum, the filing with the council of the report of the Office de consultation publique
replaces, for the purposes of section 128 of the Act respecting land use planning and development, the public
meeting to be held pursuant to section 125 of that Act.
For the purposes of sections 130 to 137 of the Act respecting land use planning and development enabling
a project referred to in subparagraph 5 of the first paragraph of section 89 to be carried out, if that project is
situated in the declared heritage site of Vieux-Montréal,
(1) applications to take part in a referendum following the second draft by-law may originate in the whole
borough in which the project is planned or from all the boroughs affected by the project;
(2) the public notice provided for in section 132 need not mention or contain a description of the zones or
sectors of a zone in which an application may originate;
(3) the application provided for in section 133 need not clearly state in which zone or sector of a zone it
originates;
(4) despite section 136.1 of that Act, a by-law adopted under section 136 of that Act must be approved by
the qualified voters of either the borough or all the boroughs affected by the project.
However,
(1) the fourth paragraph does not apply to a by-law adopted to enable the carrying out of a project,
referred to in subparagraph 5 of the first paragraph of section 89, planned by the Government or one of its
ministers, mandataries or bodies;
(2) the second paragraph and sections 125 to 127 of the Act respecting land use planning and
development do not apply to a draft by-law adopted solely to enable the carrying out of a project referred to in
subparagraph 4 of the first paragraph of section 89.
2001, c. 25, s. 265; O.C. 1308-2001, s. 11; 2003, c. 19, s. 63; 2008, c. 18, s. 6; 2011, c. 21, s. 219.
89.1.1. For the purposes of sections 89 and 89.1, if the decision to carry out a project referred to in the
first paragraph of section 89 or to authorize its carrying out, subject to the applicable planning rules, is part of
the exercise of an urban agglomeration power provided for in the Act respecting the exercise of certain
municipal powers in certain urban agglomerations (chapter E‐20.001), the reference to a by-law adopted by a
borough council also includes a by-law adopted by the council of a municipality mentioned in section 4 of
that Act.
The modification provided for in the first paragraph also applies to any other modification incidental to
that Act, in particular the modifications whereby the reference to the city council is a reference to the urban
agglomeration council and the reference to the territory of the city is a reference to the urban agglomeration.
The latter modification applies in particular, in the case referred to in the first paragraph, for the purposes of

any zone within the territory of the municipality and requires that the draft by-law be submitted for approval
to all the qualified voters, the territory is replaced by the territory formed by the borough concerned and any
borough contiguous to it, and the qualified voters are the qualified voters of those boroughs;

149.1. The city is subject to the rules provided for by the applicable legislation in respect of all the local
municipalities, in particular the rules that prevent the fixing of different general property tax rates according
to the parts of the municipal territory and the rules that provide for the use of specific sources of revenue to
finance expenditures relating to debts.
The city may, however, depart from those rules but only insofar as is necessary for the application of any
of the provisions of this division or of section 8.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; O.C. 1308-2001, s. 15.

revenues provided for in each budget adopted for those two fiscal years shall be considered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a statement comparing the revenues provided for in the budget and
those which, according to later forecasts, will be the revenues of the fiscal year shows the necessity to update
budgetary forecasts, the updated forecasts shall be considered, provided that the statement is filed before the
city adopts the budget for the following fiscal year. If several statements are filed successively, the last one
shall be considered.

150.1. The city may, for a fiscal year, fix any general property tax rate in such manner that, in relation to
the preceding fiscal year, the increase in the tax burden borne by the aggregate of the units of assessment
situated in a sector and in respect of which all or part of the rate applies is not greater than 5%.
The tax burden shall consist of
(1) the revenues derived from the general property tax which result from the application of all or part of a
rate of that tax;
(2) the revenues derived from other taxes, including the taxes imposed on the basis of the rental value of
immovables and compensations considered by the applicable legislation to be taxes, in particular the taxes
used to finance services such as the supply of drinking water, waste water purification, snow removal, waste
disposal, and residual materials upgrading;
(2.1) the revenues considered in establishing the aggregate taxation rate and derived from compensations
and modes of tariffing not referred to in subparagraph 2;
(3) the revenues derived from the amounts to stand in lieu of taxes that must be paid in respect of
immovables by the Government in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1) or by the Government in accordance with section 254 and the first
paragraph of section 255 of that Act, or by the Crown in right of Canada or by one of its mandataries;
(4) the revenues of which the city has deprived itself by granting a credit in respect of any of the sources
of revenue referred to in any of subparagraphs 1 to 3, for the application of section 8 as regards the allocation
of the credit from a surplus.
However, the revenues referred to in the second paragraph which are used to finance expenditures relating
to debts shall be excluded from the tax burden.
The rate specific to the category referred to in section 244.36 of the Act respecting municipal taxation is
not a general property tax rate to which the first paragraph and subparagraph 1 of the second paragraph
applies. For the purposes of subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the second paragraph, “immovables” means business
establishments when the business tax or the sum in lieu thereof is involved.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; O.C. 1308-2001, s. 17; 2001, c. 68, s. 127.

The revenues derived from the amounts to stand in lieu of the business tax that must be paid by the
Government in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210 or the second paragraph of section 254
and the first paragraph of section 255 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), or that must be
paid by the Crown in right of Canada or one of its mandataries, shall be included in those revenues.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; 2001, c. 68, s. 128.
150.3. If the city avails itself of any of the powers provided for in sections 150.1 and 150.2, it may replace
the maximum percentage increase in that section by another maximum percentage increase, applicable only to
the group formed of the sectors concerned, which must be less than 5%.
2001, c. 25, s. 286.
150.4. Where the increase under section 150.1 or 150.2 does not result solely from the constitution of the
city, the maximum shall apply only in respect of the part of the increase that results from the constitution.
2001, c. 25, s. 286.

150.5. If the city avails itself of any of the powers provided for in sections 150.1 and 150.2, it shall,
subject to any regulation under the second paragraph, prescribe the rules to determine whether the increase
under that section results solely from the constitution of the city and, if not, to establish the part resulting from
the constitution.
The Government may, by regulation, determine the only cases in which an increase is deemed not to result
from the constitution of the city.

2001, c. 25, s. 286; 2004, c. 20, s. 56.
150.7. The city may prescribe the rules enabling it to grant an abatement for a fiscal year in such manner
that, in relation to the preceding fiscal year, any increase in the tax burden borne by a unit of assessment or a
business establishment is not greater than 5%.
The last three paragraphs of section 150.1 and sections 150.2 to 150.5 apply, with the necessary
modifications, for the purposes of the limitation on the increase under the first paragraph.
If it avails itself of the power provided for in the first paragraph, the city shall determine the rules to enable
the rules set out in the provisions among those referred to in the second paragraph which take into
consideration aggregates of units or of establishments, to be adapted to each unit of assessment or business
establishment considered individually.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; O.C. 1308-2001, s. 18; 2004, c. 20, s. 57.
§ 3. — Limitation on decreases in the tax burden
151. The city may, for a fiscal year, fix any general property tax rate in such manner that, in relation to the
preceding fiscal year, the decrease in the tax burden borne by the aggregate of the units of assessment situated
in a sector and in respect of which all or part of the rate applies is not greater than the percentage, applicable
only to the group formed of the sectors concerned, fixed by the city.

preceding fiscal year, the decrease in the revenues derived from that tax in respect of the aggregate of the
business establishments situated in a sector is not greater than the percentage, applicable only to the group
formed of the sectors concerned, fixed by the city.
The revenues derived from the amounts to stand in lieu of the business tax that must be paid by the
Government in accordance with the second paragraph of section 210 or the second paragraph of section 254
and the first paragraph of section 255 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), or that must be
paid by the Crown in right of Canada or one of its mandataries, shall be included in those revenues.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; 2001, c. 68, s. 130.
151.2. If the city does not avail itself of the power provided for in section 151 or 151.1, it may prescribe
the rules enabling it to require a supplement for a fiscal year in such manner that, in relation to the preceding
fiscal year, the decrease in the tax burden borne by any unit of assessment or any business establishment is not

For each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the city must impose the general property tax under section
244.29 of the Act respecting municipal taxation, with a rate specific to the category referred to in section
244.36 of that Act, and for that purpose comply with the rules provided for in the following paragraphs the

As regards a sector in which the general property tax was imposed for the fiscal year 2001 at such a
specific rate, or a sector in which the surtax on vacant land was imposed for that fiscal year, the specific rate
the city fixes in order to comply with the obligation imposed by the second paragraph must be equal to twice

151.6. The city may establish a program for the purpose of granting, in the circumstances described in the
second paragraph, a subsidy or a credit to the debtor of the general property tax imposed, for any of the fiscal
years referred to in the fourth paragraph, on any unit of assessment that is eligible according to the rules
provided for in the fifth paragraph.
The subsidy or credit may be granted where the following conditions are met:
(1) for a particular fiscal year, the rental tax is not imposed in respect of a sector, either separately or
within the whole territory of the city, or it is reduced in respect of that sector to an extent significant enough,
according to the rules set out in the program, to warrant the granting of a subsidy or a credit in respect of the
eligible units of assessment;
(2) the rental tax was imposed in respect of the sector referred to in subparagraph 1, for the fiscal year
preceding the fiscal year referred to in that subparagraph, without being imposed in respect of the whole
territory of the city;
(3) in respect of the sector referred to in subparagraph 1 and for the fiscal year referred to in that
subparagraph, the estimated general property tax revenues derived from the application of all or part of any of
the rates specific to the categories provided for in sections 244.33 and 244.34 of the Act respecting municipal
taxation (chapter F‐2.1), combined, where applicable, with the estimated revenues derived from the tax
imposed pursuant to the sixth paragraph of section 101 of Schedule C, are greater than they would have been
were it not for the loss of or reduction in rental tax revenues; and
(4) the city does not avail itself of the power provided for in section 244.59 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation.
For the purposes of the second paragraph, “rental tax” means the business tax, the tax provided for in
section 101 of Schedule C where its rate is based on the rental value, or the combination of those two taxes if
the condition set out in subparagraph 1 of that paragraph is met simultaneously for the two taxes in respect of
the sector referred to in that subparagraph.
The fiscal years for which the subsidy or credit may be granted are the fiscal year referred to in
subparagraph 1 of the second paragraph and the next two fiscal years.
The eligible units of assessment are determined among the units of assessment situated in the sector
referred to in subparagraph 1 of the second paragraph and that belong to the group described in section 244.31
of the Act respecting municipal taxation. The program shall set out rules to determine the eligibility of units
of assessment. The rules may, for that purpose, use criteria that are based on
(1) the value of the unit;
(2) the vacant nature, as defined by the rules, of the land in the unit;
(3) the vacancy, as defined by the rules, of the unit or of certain of its parts;
(4) the transfer of the tax burden, as defined by the rules, measured in respect of the unit.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
The credit shall diminish the amount payable of the general property tax imposed on any eligible unit of
assessment in respect of which all or part of a rate referred to in subparagraph 3 of the second paragraph
applies. The amount of the subsidy or credit shall be established according to the rules set out in the program.
The rules may define categories among the units concerned and vary according to those categories. The rules
shall also specify the conditions and procedures for the granting of the subsidy or credit.
The cost of the aggregate of the subsidies or credits granted in respect of the units of assessment situated in
a sector shall be a burden on the aggregate of the units situated in the sector that belong to the group described
in section 244.31 of the Act respecting municipal taxation.
2001, c. 25, s. 286; 2001, c. 68, s. 134; 2002, c. 77, s. 16; 2004, c. 20, s. 64; 2006, c. 31, s. 7.
151.6.1. The city may establish a program for the purpose of granting a subsidy, in the circumstances
described in subparagraphs 1 to 3 of the second paragraph of section 151.6 and for any of the fiscal years
referred to in the fourth paragraph of that section, to any eligible lessee.
A lessee referred to in subparagraph g or h of paragraph 1 of section 236 of the Act respecting municipal
taxation (chapter F-2.1) or in any of paragraphs 3 to 5 of that section is, among the lessees whose lease is
entered into for all or part of a unit of assessment situated in the sector referred to in subparagraph 1 of the
second paragraph of section 151.6 and that belongs to the group described in section 244.31 of that Act, an
eligible lessee.
The amount of the subsidy is established according to the rules set out by the program. The rules may
define categories among the eligible lessees and vary according to those categories. The rules shall also
specify the conditions and procedures for the granting of the subsidy.
The cost of the aggregate of the subsidies granted to the lessees of units of assessment situated in a sector
shall be a burden on the aggregate of the units situated in the sector that belong to the group described in
section 244.31 of the Act respecting municipal taxation.
2002, c. 77, s. 16.
151.6.2. Where a unit of assessment situated in a sector that belongs to the group described in section
244.31 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1) is the subject of a lease that is in force on the
first day following the fiscal year of reference, within the meaning of the second paragraph, and that does not
allow the owner to increase the rent stipulated to take into account new taxes for which the owner becomes
the debtor, or to have the lessee otherwise assume payment of such a tax, the owner may nonetheless, in
accordance with the rules set out in this section, increase the rent stipulated to take into account all or part of
the additional amount payable by the owner for a fiscal year in relation to the fiscal year of reference by
reason of the imposition of a mode of property taxation specific to the non-residential sector.
The fiscal year of reference is the last fiscal year for which the city imposes the rental tax in respect of the
sector concerned, either separately or within the whole territory of the city. “Rental tax” means the business
tax or the tax provided for in section 101 of Schedule C where its rate is based on the rental value. Where one
of those taxes ceases to be imposed in respect of the sector while the other continues to be imposed, the fiscal
year of reference is determined on the basis of the first tax.
The rent that may be so increased is the rent payable for the period, subsequent to the fiscal year of
reference, in which the lease is effective and that includes all or part of a fiscal year for which the amount
referred to in the first paragraph is payable.
However, the rent stipulated in a lease entered into for part of the unit of assessment that does not
constitute premises within the meaning of the last two paragraphs of section 244.34 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation, cannot be so increased.
Updated to N1ovember 10 2024

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
Where the lease is entered into for such premises among other premises within the unit of assessment, the
increase in rent shall take into account only the proportion of the amount referred to in the first paragraph that
corresponds to the proportion that the premises under lease are of the total of the rental values of all the
premises at the end of the fiscal year of reference. However, another proportion, as agreed upon by the owner
and all the lessees of the premises, may be established.
Subject to the seventh and eighth paragraphs, the amount payable for a fiscal year by reason of the
imposition of a mode of property taxation specific to the non-residential sector is,
(1) where under section 244.29 of the Act respecting municipal taxation, the city fixes a general property
tax rate specific to the category provided for in section 244.33 of that Act, the difference obtained by
subtracting the amount of the tax that would be payable if only the basic rate provided for in section 244.38 of
that Act were applied from the amount of the tax payable in respect of the unit of assessment for the fiscal
year ; or
(2) (subparagraph repealed).
Where the city avails itself of the power under the sixth paragraph of section 101 of Schedule C to impose
the tax provided for in that section for a fiscal year, the total obtained by adding the amount of that tax
payable in respect of the unit of assessment and the amount determined under the sixth paragraph of this
section is the amount payable for that fiscal year by reason of the imposition of a mode of property taxation
specific to the non-residential sector.
For the fiscal year before the end of which the lease ceases to be effective, the amount payable by reason of
the imposition of a mode of property taxation specific to the non-residential sector is the product obtained by
multiplying the amount determined under the sixth or the seventh paragraph, as the case may be, by the
quotient resulting from the division of the number of whole days in the fiscal year that have elapsed at the
time at which the lease ceases to be effective, by 365 or by 366 in the case of a leap year.
Sections 491 and 244.64 of the Act respecting municipal taxation apply respectively, with the necessary
modifications, for the purpose of interpreting the words “owner” and “tax” used in this section.

(5) the Régime de retraite des employés manuels de la Ville de Montréal, registered under number 27494;
(6) the Régime de retraite des pompiers de la Ville de Montréal, registered under number 22503.
Such a regulation may, from any date that it determines and that may be prior to the date of its coming into
force, amend or repeal any provision contained in sections 29 to 32 of the Act respecting the negotiation of
agreements concerning the reduction of labour costs in the municipal sector (1998, chapter 2).
37.2. Despite the requirement set out in a pension plan of the former Ville de Saint-Laurent or the
Communauté urbaine de Montréal that a division of the assets and liabilities of the plan or a merger of the
assets and liabilities with those of other plans be subject to consent, no such consent is required if
(1) the division or merger concerns active members who are officers or employees represented by a certified
association within the meaning of the Labour Code (chapter C-27) and non-active members who, on the day
before the day on which their active membership in the plan ended, were such officers or employees of the
city, of the former Ville de Saint-Laurent or of the Communauté urbaine de Montréal and results from an
agreement entered into by the city and one or more of those associations, representing all the active members
concerned by the merger, with respect to grouping together those active and non-active members under a
single pension plan; or
(2) the division or merger concerns active members who are officers or employees not described in
subparagraph 1 and non-active members who, on the day before the day on which their active membership in
the plan ended, were such officers or employees of the city, of the former Ville de Saint-Laurent or of the
Communauté urbaine de Montréal.
However, a division or merger only concerns an active member described in subparagraph 2 of the first
paragraph if an agreement has been entered into for that purpose between the city and the member.
No obligation relating to the unconverted benefits accrued under a defined contribution plan or in a voluntary
contribution account may be transferred to another plan by a merger referred to in the first paragraph.

The agenda paper must contain a detailed list of the business that will be submitted to the council.
42. No business other than that specified in the notice of meeting shall be considered at a council meeting,

For the purposes of the first paragraph, the city may determine the terminology and set forth rules respecting
the drafting, reference to and publication of the revised by-laws; it may also set forth all the necessary rules in
respect of the coming into force of the revised by-laws and provide for an annual updating method that will
allow for continuous revision.
Nothing in this section may be interpreted as affecting any matter or thing done or required to be done, any
resolutions, decisions, orders or other proceedings of the city, any debentures, bonds, notes or other securities
issued, any collection rolls for special taxes, or the rights and duties of municipal officers, which shall
continue to be governed by the previous by-laws until the expiry of the term fixed.
46. The scope of application of any by-law may be limited to a part only of the territory of the city.
47. The city may, by by-law, authorize the executive committee or a borough council to make orders
related to any by-law; such authorization shall specify the object of each order.
Such orders shall be part of the relevant by-laws and shall become compulsory upon publication, in a
newspaper distributed in the city, of a notice specifying the object thereof and indicating the date they were
made.
§2.—Penalties enacted by by-law
48. For by-laws respecting fire prevention, noise control, residual material management or the alteration of
residential buildings involving a reduction in the number of housing units or in the housing surface, the city
may prescribe a minimum fine not exceeding $2,000 and a maximum fine not exceeding $10,000.
For a subsequent offence, the city may prescribe a minimum fine not exceeding $4,000 and a maximum fine
not exceeding $20,000.

special tax levied for the object of the permit or licence or to the cost of the permit or licence, as the case may
be.
For any subsequent offence, the city may prescribe that the amount of the fine be equal to twice the amount of
the fines provided for in the first paragraph.
The execution of the judgment against the offender does not exempt him or her from the obligation to pay the
special tax or from obtaining the permit or licence required or if he or she is entitled thereto.

The expense, which may be increased to take into account any reasonable accessory expenses incurred by the
city and made necessary by an intervention under the first paragraph, constitutes a prior claim on the
immovable, of the same nature and with the same rank as the claims described in paragraph 5 of article 2651
of the Civil Code.
The expense is secured by a legal hypothec on the immovable.
The city may not exercise its power under the first paragraph with respect to an immovable owned by a public
body within the meaning of the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection
of personal information (chapter A-2.1).
§9.—Financial assistance
81. The city may, by by-law, establish a program under which the city grants, in accordance with this
paragraph, subsidies or tax credits to operators of bed and breakfast establishments within the meaning of the
Tourist Establishments Act (chapter E-15.1).

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
The by-law shall provide rules for establishing the amount of the subsidy or of the tax credit, the conditions to
be met for the subsidy or tax credit to be granted and the terms under which the subsidy is paid or the tax
credit is granted.
82. The city may, by by-law, adopt a revitalization program or a plan of action providing, in particular, that
the city grants subsidies for the construction, reconstruction, renovation, conversion, restoration, extension,
relocation, removal, development, re-development or demolition of any immovable or for alterations in the
connection of electric power lines and accessories.
The amount of the subsidy may in no case exceed the actual cost of the work.
83. Within the scope of a plan of action or revitalization program, the city may, by by-law, grant, on the
conditions and in the sectors of its territory as it determines, a subsidy to compensate for any increase in
property taxes that may result from reassessment of the immovables after completion of the work.
The amount of the subsidies referred to in the first paragraph may in no case exceed the following amounts:
(1) for the fiscal year during which the work was completed and the following fiscal year, the amount of the
subsidy shall represent no more than the difference between the amount of the property taxes that would have
been owing if the assessment of the immovable had not been changed and the amount of the taxes actually
owing; and
(2) for the second fiscal year following the fiscal year during which the work was completed, half of the
amount provided for in subparagraph 1 of the first paragraph.
Where any entry on the roll relating to an immovable eligible for a subsidy under this section is contested, the
subsidy is not paid until a final decision has been rendered on the contestation.
For a residential immovable, no subsidy is payable unless the owner proves, in the manner prescribed in the
by-law, that the price charged to lessees for rent has not been increased as a result of the increase in the
property taxes.
84. Within the scope of a revitalization program, the city may, by by-law, grant, on the conditions and in
the sectors of its territory as it determines, a property tax credit in consideration for admissible work carried
out on the immovables.
The tax credit granted may in no case exceed the actual cost of the work. It may be divided over more than
one fiscal year.
85. Within the scope of a plan of action to promote home ownership, the city may, by by-law, on the
conditions and in the sectors of its territory as it determines, grant subsidies or tax credits to individuals or
housing cooperatives purchasing residential immovables.
86. The city may, for the purposes referred to in sections 82 to 85 of this Schedule, establish categories of
immovables and classes of work. It may also, for the purposes referred to in section 84, establish classes of
property taxes.
The city may combine the classes and categories provided for in the first paragraph. It may establish different
conditions in keeping with the classes and categories or combinations of classes and categories and order that
a subsidy or tax credit be granted only in respect of one or several of the classes and categories or
combinations of classes and categories.
The city may avail itself of the first and second paragraphs differently according to the sectors of the city that
it determines.

87. For the purposes of sections 82 to 85 of this Schedule and section 148.0.25 of the Act respecting land
use planning and development (chapter A-19.1), the city may, in each case, establish various classes of
recipients and fix different subsidy rates for the different classes.
It may also limit the eligibility of individuals for subsidies on the basis of the maximum allowable household
income and, for that purpose, define the concept of household income and prescribe the modes of evaluation
and control of such limitation.
88. The city may, by by-law, require that applicants for a subsidy referred to in sections 82 to 85 of this
Schedule and section 148.0.25 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1),
(1) obtain the subsidies or grants that are available under provincial or federal programs for the same
purposes; and;
(2) produce an owner/lessee agreement, signed by a majority of the lessees, concerning the nature of the work
to be carried out and possible rent increase.
Similarly, the city may require that the recipient of a subsidy prove, in the manner prescribed by by-law, that
the amounts received as subsidies are deducted from the work costs taken into account in establishing the
rents after completion of the work.
89. The city may, by by-law, in respect of a subsidy paid within the scope of a by-law passed under
sections 82 to 85 of this Schedule and section 148.0.25 of the Act respecting land use planning and
development (chapter A-19.1),
(1) stipulate, in the circumstances as provided for in the by-law, that any change in the destination or mode of
occupancy of the immovable and that the alienation of all or any part thereof or the transfer of control by the
legal person that owns the immovable, within a period of no more than ten years, fixed by the city, shall entail
repayment to the city, in such proportion as the city shall determine according to how much time has elapsed,
of the subsidy paid by the city in respect of the immovable, or that any permit required for a change of
destination or occupancy may be refused until such repayment is made;
(2) provide that repayment of the subsidy shall be payable by any person who was the owner of the
immovable at the time of the change in its destination or mode of occupancy, its alienation or the transfer of
control by the legal person that owns the immovable, or by any subsequent purchaser; and
(3) prescribe the formalities necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements set out pursuant to
subparagraphs 1 and 2 of the first paragraph.
If the by-law contains provisions adopted under subparagraph 2 or 3 of the first paragraph, the owner who
receives the subsidy must have a document registered establishing the restrictions so stipulated to the right of
ownership of the immovable. Registration of such document in the land register shall be made by deposit and
the Land Registrar is required to receive it and to make mention of it in that register.
90. Sections 82 to 86 of this Schedule and section 148.0.25 of the Act respecting land use planning and
development (chapter A-19.1) applies notwithstanding the Municipal Aid Prohibition Act (chapter I-15).
§10.— Municipal finances
91. At the end of each fiscal year, the treasurer shall prepare the financial statements and reports for such
fiscal year with respect to the city’s revenues and expenditures and its financial status. Such reports and
statements shall specify separately the balance sheet and revenue and expenditure account and contain all
other necessary information.
92. The executive committee shall draw up the city’s budget. It shall file the budget with the office of the
clerk, with its recommendations on that budget and the budget of the Société de transport. The clerk shall

send a copy of each document so filed and of the budget of the Société de transport to each member of the
council, no later than 1 December.
93. On the filing of the budget or no later than 31 December each year, the treasurer shall determine, in a
certificate, the appropriations considered necessary for the next fiscal year for payment of the interest on
securities issued or to be issued by the city, for repayment or redemption of such securities and for their
sinking funds and any other charge related to the city’s debt, with the exception, however, of the amounts
required in principal, interest and accessories in relation to the issue of treasury bills, loans made in
anticipation of revenue and renewable loans falling due during the fiscal year covered by the budget. The
treasurer shall also determine in such certificate the appropriations necessary, during the following fiscal year,
to assume the obligations contracted by the city during previous fiscal years. The treasurer may amend the
certificate until 31 December preceding the fiscal year to which it applies if the appropriations referred to
therein have not been adopted by the council. The treasurer shall file the certificate and any amendments
thereto with the office of the clerk. The clerk shall notify the council at the first meeting held after the filing.
The treasurer shall also include in the certificate referred to in the first paragraph the appropriations needed,
during the next fiscal year, to assume the obligations of the city arising from collective agreements or from its
by-laws, or arising under legislative or regulatory provisions adopted by the Gouvernement du Québec, the
Government of Canada or any of their ministers or agencies.
The amounts shown in the certificate shall be included in the city’s budget for the fiscal year covered by the
budget.
94. (Repealed).
95. (Repealed).
96. The presumption of adoption and the coming into force of the budget provided for in section 148.1 of
this Act do not apply to the appropriations provided for in the treasurer’s certificate referred to in section 93,
where those appropriations are deemed to have been adopted on 1 January and to have come into force on that
date.
97. After 1 January, the adoption, of the budget or any of its appropriations is retroactive to that date. The
same rule applies to the by-laws and resolutions arising therefrom.
§11.— Taxes and permits
I.—General
98. Taxes and any account or amount owing to the city shall bear interest from the day they become owing
without its being necessary to make a special request therefor. The city shall, as often as it deems it expedient,
fix the rate of interest that applies. The tax account shall specify clearly the rate of interest in force at the time
of its sending.
That rate shall also apply to all debts outstanding before that fiscal year until another rate is fixed under the
first paragraph.
Subject to the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19) and
this Schedule and to any by-law, order, contract or agreement that may fix another date for the payment of the
amounts owing to the city, all amounts owing to the city are payable 30 days after sending the account of the
city.
99. Notwithstanding section 32 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), a building shall
be entered on the roll when three years have elapsed from the beginning of the work if the amounts spent or
committed in the first two years represent at least $50,000,000.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
However, if such a building is substantially completed or occupied before three years have elapsed, the
building shall be entered on the roll.
99.1. For the purposes of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1), the Société de la
prévention de la cruauté contre les animaux de Montréal is deemed to have obtained a property tax and a
business tax exemption under Division III.0.1 of Chapter XVIII of that Act for any immovable of which the
Société is the owner and where it carries on mainly the activities consistent with its mission.
The first paragraph applies for the purposes of every fiscal year as of the fiscal year 2004.
100. The city may accept the transfer of immovables on which taxes are owing, in payment of such taxes.
101. To compensate for the cost of water service and the other services identified by by-law, the city may,
by by-law, levy a water-rate and service tax or any of those taxes separately and determine the method of
payment, when the tax is payable and the manner in which it may be levied or collected. The by-law must
specify the portion of the receipts of that tax to be allotted to each of the services it finances.
Where the city levies a tax provided for in the first paragraph, the by-law may vary the rate thereof according
to the various classes of occupation based on any or on a combination of the following criteria:
(1) a fixed rate;
(2) a rate established according to consumption;
(3) a rate based on the rental value.
The city may exempt occupants of residential immovables from the water-rate and service tax and, according
to the classes it determines, persons exempt from the business tax.
The lessee of a dwelling in respect of which the tax has been incorporated into the rent for any fiscal year
during which the exemption applies is entitled, on application to the lessor within 12 months after the coming
into force of the by-law imposing the water-rate and service tax for that fiscal year, to an adjustment in rent
for that fiscal year.
The Administrative Housing Tribunal has jurisdiction, to the exclusion of any court, to hear an application for
adjustment in the rent of a dwelling referred to in the fourth paragraph. Sections 56 to 90 of the Act respecting
the Administrative Housing Tribunal (chapter T-15.01), adapted as required, apply to the application.
In addition to the powers provided for in the first three paragraphs, the city may, by by-law, levy the water-
rate and service tax on the units of assessment belonging to the group described in section 244.31 of the Act
respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1) when, under section 244.29 of that Act, it fixes various general
property tax rates.
Sections 244.30 to 244.64 of that Act apply, with the necessary modifications, with respect to the water-rate
and service tax levied under the sixth paragraph.
In addition to being a prior claim within the meaning of paragraph 5 of article 2651 of the Civil Code, the tax
is secured by a legal hypothec on the immovable.
A water-rate and service tax levied under the sixth paragraph does not apply to outdoor parking lots that
constitute a unit of assessment belonging to the category described in section 244.36 of the Act respecting
municipal taxation or to the land which forms the road bed of the railway of a railway company, within the
meaning of section 47 of that Act.
102. Section 151.3 of this Act applies, adapted as required, to the water-rate and service tax levied under
section 101.

Despite the Act respecting the exercise of certain municipal powers in certain urban agglomerations (chapter
E-20.001), the urban agglomeration council of the city may not levy that tax, on the basis of rental value, in
the territory of a reconstituted municipality.
102.1. (Repealed).
102.2. The city may, by by-law, impose an annual tax for the presence in its territory of an advertising
installation such as a sign or a billboard situated elsewhere than at the place where the object of the
advertisement is located.
The debtor of the tax is the person responsible for the presence of the installation.
The amount of the tax is based on the number of sign faces on the structure. A surface that displays a series of
different advertisements rotating in a loop by mechanical or electronic means constitutes one sign face.
The by-law defines the installations to which it applies and specifies those for which no tax is applicable.
II.—Collection roll and collection of taxes
103. The treasurer may enter on the property tax collection roll the franchises, rights and privileges for
occupation or use of the public domain that are established during a fiscal year, taking into account the
unexpired portion of the fiscal year.
The treasurer may cancel the rent fixed for any such privilege, or reduce it in proportion to the period expired,
when it comes to an end during a fiscal year; such cancellation or reduction shall be effective from the day
when, as ascertained by him, such privilege ceased to exist.
104. The treasurer may make credit entries of payments in the margin of the property tax collection roll
and the collection roll for personal and business taxes and water-rates, and enter all necessary figures to
establish the unpaid balance outstanding at the end of the fiscal year. The treasurer may also correct
calculation and clerical errors in the collection roll and make the entries required therein.
Where the treasurer has corrected a roll for the purposes provided for in the first paragraph, the treasurer shall
inform the ratepayers affected by means of a notice sent by registered mail.
III.— Seizure and sale of movables for non-payment of taxes
105. The personal taxes levied for a fiscal year shall constitute, until the expiry of a period of six months
following the end of the fiscal year, a prior claim of the same nature and with the same rank as the claims
referred to in paragraph 5 of article 2651 of the Civil Code on movable property, goods and effects found in
the business establishment of any ratepayer liable for the payment of such taxes, as long as they remain in the
premises assessed, even if they change owners under a mutually agreed transfer. The city may, until the expiry
of that period, register a legal hypothec on the movable property, goods and effects. The business
establishment of the ratepayer bound to pay such taxes is that specified in the roll.
106. The prior claim and the legal hypothec granted to the city by the law for all personal taxes owing to it
and for interest thereon and collection costs shall extend to all movable goods, property and effects that may
be found upon the premises occupied by the debtor on the day of the seizure referred to in section 107 and
shall also extend to any other movable goods and effects that may belong to the debtor, wherever they may be
at the time of their seizure.
107. When a ratepayer fails to pay taxes that are owing, the treasurer, after issuing or sending a default
notice by registered mail, may, as of the sixteenth day following the date the notice was sent, recover the
amount with interest and legal costs by means of an order obtained from the municipal court, authorizing the
seizure and sale of the movable goods and effects subject to the prior claim securing such taxes, with the
exception of property declared unseizable by the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25.01).

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
108. Before proceeding with the sale of the movable property, the bailiff charged with executing the order
shall give public notice thereof. The bailiff shall specify in such notice the name of the debtor in default, the
amount owing and the day and place of the sale, and shall post it in a conspicuous place at the entrance of the
city hall.
109. At least eight days before the sale, the bailiff shall notify a copy of such notice to the debtor at his or
her domicile, if known, and failing such domicile, at the debtor’s ordinary residence, business office or
commercial establishment.
Upon a return attesting that the debtor has no known domicile, business office, commercial establishment or
ordinary residence, a judge of the municipal court shall prescribe the mode of notification of such notice.
IV.—Suits for recovery of taxes
110. Notwithstanding any inconsistent legislative provision of any general law or special act, the treasurer
may take before the court of primary jurisdiction, without any authorization, all proceedings the treasurer may
deem expedient to collect the taxes and dues owed to the city.
For that purpose, the treasurer may sign any procedural document required and act before the municipal court
on behalf of the city, except where the proceedings are contested.
V.—Sale of immovables for non-payment of taxes
111. Before 1 September each year, the treasurer shall prepare a notice addressed to the last owner entered
on the collection roll of each immovable on which property taxes that were owing in a previous fiscal year
remain unpaid.
Subject to the second paragraph of section 515 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19), such notice shall
contain
(a) the name of the owner on the collection roll on the date when such notice is made out;
(b) the designation of the immovable as it appears on the said roll;
(c) the total amount of taxes owing without it being necessary to specify whether it refers to general or special
municipal or school taxes, apportionments for sewers, pavings, sidewalks or expropriations or costs of notices
and service;
(d) a demand for payment of the taxes plus the costs of the notice and its service, within ten days of the date
of service or mailing of the notice, stating that if not paid within the period prescribed, the immovable will be
sold under judicial authority.
112. Once the time limit stipulated in the notice prescribed in section 111 expires, the treasurer shall draw
up, certify and send to the clerk a statement containing a summary description of all immovables to be sold
for taxes.
The statement need only designate the immovables by their cadastral or subdivision numbers, adding thereto
the letter P for parts of lots. The name of the street where each immovable is situated and the civic number of
any buildings must be specified; the first and last numbers, joined by a dash, is sufficient where there are
several. The number of the tax account relating to each immovable must also be specified.
The clerk shall, without the formality of minutes of seizure, proceed with the sale of all immovables described
in the statement in the manner prescribed in section 113 of this Schedule and in sections 517 to 535 of the
Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19).
113. The clerk shall give public notice, specifying
Updated to N1ovember 10 2024

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
(1) the day, time and place of the sale;
(2) the immovables to be sold;
(3) the name of the owner of each of the immovables, as entered on the property assessment roll;
(4) the tax account number relating to each of the immovables;
(5) the amount of tax owing on each of the immovables, to which interest, penalties and costs shall be added
at the time of the sale or of the settlement of the debt, where applicable.
The executive committee shall determine a tariff of costs applicable to sales. The tariff may provide for a
uniform rate for all immovables, rates that vary according to categories of immovables determined by by-law,
rates that are fixed or variable according to categories of immovables determined by by-law, or any
combination thereof. However, the rate established by the tariff may not, for any one immovable, exceed 5%
of the capital amount of the unpaid debt. The costs have the same order of preference as municipal taxes.
The notice need only identify each immovable, specifying, for an immovable upon which a building is built,
the tax account number relating to the immovable, the name of the street where it is situated and the civic
number or numbers of the building or buildings, giving the first and last number joined by a dash where there
are several. Where no building is constructed thereon, the immovable shall be designated by its first cadastral
number and first subdivision number as they appear in the statement provided by section 112, followed by the
abbreviation “etc.” where there are more than one; the tax account number relating to the immovable must
also be stated.
Furthermore, when an immovable is in the name of more than one owner, it shall be sufficient to name one of
the owners in the notice and add “et al.”. Such notice shall refer to the statement prepared by the treasurer
under section 112.
At least one month before the date set for the sale, the clerk shall have the notice published in a newspaper
distributed in the city.
For the purposes of this Division, the description of an immovable that is a unit of assessment entered on the
assessment roll separately from the land on which it is situated consists of the description of that land and a
summary description of the immovable referred to, along with, if possible, the name of its owner, its civic
address and any other information that may help to identify it.
VI.—Purchase by the municipality of immovables sold for taxes
114. Where the city purchases an immovable under section 536 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter
C-19), it shall have the immovable entered in the city’s name on the assessment and collection rolls for
property, general and special taxes, and on the apportionment rolls for local improvement taxes, and shall tax
it like any other immovable subject to taxation; nevertheless, the city shall not be subject to pay school taxes.
If such immovable is redeemed, the repurchase price shall include, in addition to the amounts referred to in
the second paragraph of section 537 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19), the general or special
property taxes owing and the instalments of local improvement taxes encumbering such immovable owing
since the sale, the excess over revenue of the expenses incurred by the city to ensure the preservation of the
immovable, as well as all taxes not paid out of the proceeds of the sale. After redemption, the local
improvement tax instalments not yet owing shall continue to encumber the immovable and the owner shall be
personally responsible therefor. The provisions of section 532 of the Cities and Towns Act shall also apply to
the redemption of such immovable.
After the expiry of the period for repurchase, the school tax and any other municipal tax levied during such
period shall be struck from the collection roll if there has been no repurchase.

appropriations for the three fiscal years following the year of the election.
118. The city may, with the authorization of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land
Occupancy, increase the amount of any loan to be made or renewed by the estimated cost of the discount on
the bonds and the expenses incidental to their issue.
119. (Repealed).
120. The executive committee may, by resolution, order temporary loans for the payment of current
administration expenses and contract them on the conditions and for the term it determines.
The executive committee may also make loans for the payment of the expenses incurred under a loan by-law.
121. Where a loan has been ordered by by-law, the executive committee may make it by issuing securities
or by contract, up to the total amount of principal referred to in the by-law.
The executive committee shall determine
(1) the rate of interest on the loan or securities, or the manner of fixing such rate;
(2) the time the loan is made;
(3) the contents of the securities or of the contracts; and
(4) the conditions of issue of the securities.
The executive committee may also conclude contracts for the exchange of rates of interest or of currencies
related to current loans or loans to be made, as well as term or option contracts involving the rates of interest
or currencies for the purposes of repayment of the principal or payment of the interest on its loans.
The executive committee may make the loan for a term shorter than that authorized by by-law and determine
the part of the loan that shall be renewable at maturity and the maximum term of the renewal.
Any loan for the purpose of such renewal may be made within the 12 months preceding the date of maturity
of the loan to be renewed or the securities issued for that loan and within the 12 months following either of
those maturity dates, provided that the term prescribed by the executive committee for the renewal does not
exceed the maximum term determined pursuant to this section.
The executive committee may designate a place outside Québec where a register shall be kept for the
registration of securities and designate a person authorized to keep the register.
It may repay in advance a loan that may be so repaid.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
121.1. At the request of the board of directors of the Société de transport de Montréal, the executive
committee may, in accordance with section 121, make a loan ordered by a by-law of the transit authority
under section 123 of the Act respecting public transit authorities (chapter S-30.01) and over which the city has
jurisdiction under section 158.2 of that Act.
The proceeds of the loan are paid to the transit authority to serve the purposes set out in the by-law ordering
the loan.
From the time of the payment, the transit authority is in debt to the city, under repayment terms identical to
those of the loan contracted by the city, for the sums required by the city to repay the loan, including the
interest and other related fees. For that purpose, the transit authority may issue evidences of indebtedness to
the city and establish a sinking fund.
122. The Act respecting municipal debts and loans (chapter D-7) does not apply to the city, except sections
7 and 8 and Divisions V, VI, VIII to X and XII. The treasurer or any other officer designated for that purpose
by the executive committee shall fulfil the obligations referred to in section 24 of that Act.
The Minister of Finance may cause the certificate referred to in section 12 of that Act to be affixed to a
security issued by the city under a by-law in force. The validity of a security bearing such certificate is not
contestable.
Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision, the certificate referred to in section 12 of the Act respecting
municipal debts and loans does not apply to a security issued to constitute the working fund of the city or
issued to effect a temporary loan.
Division IX of that Act does not apply to a security that is not subject to registration according to the
conditions of its issue.
A loan obtained by the city or a security issued by it may be repaid or repurchased in advance, as it sees fit,
according to the terms of the contract or security. The date of advance repayment or repurchase may be other
than a date of payment of interest if the prior notice stipulated in the contract or security is given.
123. Where a by-law authorizes the city to borrow a given amount either in the legal tender of Canada or
in the currency of one or more other countries, the total amount of the loan thus authorized shall be that
expressed in the legal tender of Canada.
The amount in Canadian dollars of a loan made in another currency is calculated by multiplying the amount
of the principal of the loan by the value of the unit of the other currency in relation to the Canadian dollar.
For the purposes of the calculation referred to in the second paragraph, the value of the unit of the other
currency in relation to the Canadian dollar is as it stands
(1) at the time of the conversion into Canadian dollars of all or part of the proceeds of the loan paid to the
city; or,
(2) at noon on the day on which all or part of the proceeds of the loan are paid to the city, if it is not converted
into Canadian dollars.
Where all or part of the proceeds of a loan are used to renew a loan already made by the city, for all or part of
its unexpired term, the amount used for the renewal is not deducted from the balance of the amount of the
loan authorized by by-law, whatever the value of the currency in which the loan is made.
124. Notwithstanding any inconsistent legislative provision, the securities of the city may be issued in the
following forms or a combination thereof:

(2) securities that may be registered only for the principal; or
(3) securities payable to the bearer.
The executive committee may prescribe the mode of transfer or negotiation of the city’s securities and the
formalities to be fulfilled for that purpose.
125. Where the city makes a loan in another country, it may elect domicile in that country or elsewhere,
for the purposes of receiving a notice or proceeding respecting that loan.
In the same circumstances, the city may order that the securities issued by it or the contracts concluded by it
in another country for the purposes of the loan be governed by the law of that country, provided that the
provisions of this subdivision are complied with.
126. The bonds, notes and other securities of the city shall be signed by the mayor and the treasurer or,
instead of the latter, by the person designated for such purpose by the executive committee.
127. A facsimile of the signature of the mayor and the treasurer may be engraved, lithographed or printed
on the bonds and shall have the same effect as the signature itself.

concurrently and pari passu with all other general obligations of the city.
129. The city may create a general sinking fund for the purposes of total or partial repurchase of the
evidences of indebtedness issued by it.
130. Where the city purchases its own evidences of indebtedness bearing interest coupons to invest them
in its sinking fund, it may cancel those securities and replace them by the issue of a single security, without
coupons, registered in the name of the treasurer in trust for the purposes of the sinking fund.
131. If at any time the treasurer finds that the moneys in hand for the payment of the interest or principal
of any loan for which the city is liable will not be sufficient to pay the interest or principal at maturity, the
treasurer shall calculate the property tax required to meet the deficit, on the basis of the value of the taxable
immovables according to the assessment roll then in effect; in such calculation, the treasurer shall take into
account a fair allowance for possible expenses and losses in the collection of that tax.
The treasurer shall then issue under his or her signature a certificate imposing that tax and deliver it to the
clerk for the information of the council.
That certificate shall have the same effect as a city by-law imposing that tax.
That tax shall be levied and collected immediately, in addition to any other tax legally levied by the city.
132. The Décret concernant une exemption accordée à la Communauté urbaine de Montréal de
l’obligation d’obtenir certaines autorisations relativement à certains instruments et contrats de nature
financière (Décret 166-94 dated 26 January 1994) applies, adapted as required, to the city.

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
(1) To constitute that working fund, the executive committee may authorize the treasurer to borrow the
amounts that it deems necessary through the issue and sale of treasury bills, notes or other securities, provided
the current nominal value of such treasury bills, notes or other securities does not at any time exceed 20% of
the appropriations provided for in its budget.
(2) The treasury bills, notes or other securities may bear no nominal rate of interest, shall be payable to the
bearer or to the holder registered according to their conditions, and shall mature no more than 365 days after
the date of their issue. They may bear the mention that they are redeemable in advance, without any other
formalities or conditions than those stipulated in them.
(3) The sale of the treasury bills, notes or other securities shall be carried out by agreement or by tender. Sale
by agreement shall be made on behalf of the city by the treasurer who must, every three months, report on the
sales thus carried out to the executive committee.
For sale by tender, the tenders shall not be subject to sections 573 and 573.1 of the Cities and Towns Act
(chapter C-19), but they shall be addressed to the treasurer. The treasurer, on behalf of the city, shall make the
sale to the tenderer who submitted the tender which the treasurer deems to be the most advantageous to the
city. The treasurer shall not be bound to accept any tender.
(4) A loan may be granted from the working fund
(a) for a purpose for which the city is authorized to borrow temporarily;
(b) for the purposes of capital expenditures;
(c) in anticipation of the collection of revenue of the city or of an amount owing to it; or
(d) for the purchase of pending securities of the city that are likely to meet the requirements of a sinking fund.
The term of the loan may not exceed five yearsor, in the case provided for in subparagraph b of the first
paragraph, 10 years.
However, for loans granted pending the payment of advances on loans to be granted by the Canada Mortgage
and Housing Corporation, the loans granted out of such fund may be for a term of more than five years and
apply until any such loan is granted to the city by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
(5) Moneys out of the working fund may be invested in treasury bills or bonds or other securities provided for
in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of article 1339 of the Civil Code. Such moneys may also be placed in a chartered
bank or other financial institution authorized to receive deposits.
(6) The executive committee may authorize the treasurer to invest in such fund, for periods not to exceed 90
days, the available balance of the general fund or the temporarily unused balance of the proceeds from long-
term loans.
(7) At the end of a fiscal year, any operating surplus in the working fund shall be transferred to the general
fund, and any deficit shall be made good out of that fund.
§14.—Financial reserves
134. A by-law creating a financial reserve need not be subject to the approval of qualified voters where the
reserve is created for the benefit of the entire territory of the city.
§15.—Acquisition and expropriation of immovable rights
135. The city, for the purposes of its waterworks, may take possession of any land that is vacant or has
been built upon whenever it shall consider it advisable, even before having acquired it, by giving the owner
eight days’ prior notice in writing; it shall proceed with all possible diligence to acquire such land, however. If
it does not commence the expropriation within 60 days following the expiry of the eight-day period stipulated
in the notice, it may be compelled thereto by court order.
In all cases, it shall pay the owner interest on the expropriation indemnity from the date of taking possession.

136. The city may acquire an immovable to improve the area around streets or public places. The previous
approval of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy shall be required to exercise
such power within a radius of more than 38 m.
137. The city may accept the gratuitous transfer of any land required for the opening or widening of a
street or lane and agree with the owner that, if an expropriation tax is levied later for such improvement, an
allowance equal to the value of the land transferred at the time of the expropriation will be granted to him or
her against his or her aliquot share of the said tax, subject to his or her obligation to pay any excess.
The amount so credited shall be payable by the other owners who have not transferred their land gratuitously.
The value of the land so transferred shall be determined at the time of the expropriation in accordance with
the Act respecting expropriation (chapter E-25).
137.1. The city may acquire by agreement any immovable outside its territory that is required for the
purpose of establishing a nursery.
138. The city may acquire any immovable by agreement or expropriation for the purposes of transferring
it by means of exchange, sale or lease with a view to the implementation of a plan for the expansion of the

139. The city may,
(1) acquire by agreement or expropriation any immovable for industrial purposes;
(2) sell, lease or otherwise alienate for industrial or commercial purposes any immovable acquired under
subparagraph 1;
(3) on proof that an immovable acquired under one of its powers, including an immovable acquired under
section 144, be more adequately used for industrial purposes, sell, lease or otherwise alienate it for industrial
purposes, on the conditions it determines; and
(4) on proof that an immovable acquired under subparagraph 1 cannot be adequately used for industrial or
commercial purposes, use it or dispose of it for other purposes.
If the city takes back an immovable that has been sold, leased or otherwise alienated under subparagraphs 2
and 3 of the first paragraph to protect its claim or to exercise certain rights provided for in the contract, the
city may then dispose thereof with the same authorization and for the same purposes provided for in this
section.
The city is not subject to the Act respecting municipal industrial immovables (chapter I-0.1).
The land acquired by the city under the Industrial Funds Act (chapter F-4) is deemed to have been acquired
under subparagraph 1 of the first paragraph and any money from a sale or rental under the said Act is paid
into the general fund of the city.

Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy is required.

agreement or expropriation, with or without prior possession, all servitudes which it shall deem appropriate
(1) to permit their use or to transfer them, on the conditions it determines, to public utilities, for the laying or
installation of conduits, poles, wiring and other accessories necessary for their operations;

parking signals, parking meters, fire-alarm boxes, telephones for the use of the police, hydrants, and generally
all accessories required for the above-mentioned installations.
The servitudes referred to in this section may be established without a description of the dominant land.
141. No indemnity or damages shall be granted for buildings constructed or improvements made on an
immovable after the city adopts the resolution ordering expropriation, provided that such resolution is
followed by proceedings in expropriation within the ensuing 12 months.
Notwithstanding the first paragraph, the expropriated party shall be entitled to an indemnity for repairs made
by him or her under a permit issued by the city.
142. The executive committee may order the imposition of a reserve for public purposes. Once the order is
made, the executive committee shall submit it to the city council for approval at the first sitting that follows
the sixtieth day after it is made.
143. Notwithstanding any provision inconsistent with the Act respecting expropriation (chapter E-25) or
any other act, the city may dig a tunnel at a depth of not less than 15 m under any land for its water conduits,
its sewer conduits or for any other municipal purpose. As soon as work begins, the city becomes, without
formality or indemnity, but subject to recourse in damages, the owner of the space occupied by the tunnel and
of the two metres beyond the interior concrete wall of the tunnel.
As soon as work begins, the city shall notify the owner of the land of the work being done and of the
provisions of this section. In the year following the completion of work, the city shall file in its archives a
copy of a plan certified by the head of the department involved, showing the horizontal projection of that
tunnel. It shall file that plan with the Land Registry Office and the Land Registrar shall mention each lot or
part of a lot affected in the land register.
144. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision, the city may acquire by agreement or expropriation any
immovable whose acquisition is deemed appropriate for land reserve or housing purposes and for the work
related to such purposes, and any immovable considered obsolete or harmful for occupation.
The city may hold, lease and administer immovables acquired under the first paragraph. It may develop those
immovables and install the necessary public services therein; it may also demolish or restore the buildings and
other structures and build or construct thereon new buildings for housing, leisure activities, recreation and
other related purposes.
The city may exercise the powers provided for in the second paragraph on the immovables it already owns.
It may alienate those immovables on the conditions it determines in accordance with section 28 of the Cities
and Towns Act (chapter C-19). It may also alienate, gratuitously or on the conditions it determines, such an
immovable in favour of the Government, any of its ministers or agencies, or any person or agency referred to
in the third paragraph of section 29.4 of the Cities and Towns Act.
145. Any person responsible for administering the property of others, in particular a tutor, administrator or
trustee, who is seized or possessed of an immovable subject to expropriation, or holds an interest therein in
any of those capacities, may enter into agreements with the city to sell and transfer such immovable to it or
grant it rights in or servitudes upon such immovable on behalf of any person whom he or she represents or
whose property he or she administers, including, but without restricting the scope of the foregoing, minors,
children not yet born and persons of full age under tutorship or under a protection mandate.
Legal persons may also enter into such agreements respecting their own immovables and respecting those
which they hold in any of the capacities referred to in the preceding paragraph.

146. Every person entering into an agreement under section 145 shall be exempt from any recourse by
reason of such agreement, saving the obligation to account for the consideration or price received from the
city in consequence of such agreement to the person he or she represents.
147. Every person who may sell and transport any immovable to the city under section 145 shall also have
the power to transfer to the city gratuitously, conditionally or unconditionally such portion thereof as the
person may deem fit, for any municipal purpose.
148. In the cases of section 145, the price shall not be paid to the vendor until after the court or judge has
authorized payment thereof. If such authorization is not obtained within three months from the execution of
the transfer, the city may release itself from all further responsibility by paying the price into the hands of the
clerk of the Superior Court for the benefit of whoever may be entitled thereto.
149. When the moneys are so paid into the hands of the clerk, the clerk shall, even during vacation or out
of term, determine how the legal representatives and creditors of the party entitled to such moneys and any
other interested person are to be called in, by following the prescriptions of the Code of Civil Procedure
(chapter C-25.01); on an application or in case of contestation, the Superior Court or one of its judges shall
issue such orders as may be deemed advisable and just for the delivery or the distribution of the moneys, or
for the disposal of any other matter in connection with the claims or demands of the interested persons.
The formalities provided for in the first paragraph shall not be required where the amount deposited does not
exceed $500, and the clerk shall deliver it immediately to the expropriated party.
Where the moneys deposited are paid to the expropriated party, they shall not be subject to any tax or
commission of any kind, notwithstanding any other inconsistent legislative provision.
150. Where part of an immovable is subject to an expropriation and the indemnity paid by the city does
not exceed $5,000, the hypothecs and other charges encumbering that part of the immovable shall be cleared
upon registration of the title of the city in the land register and the Land Registrar shall cancel them.
This section applies where a servitude is acquired.
151. The deposits to which section 149 applies are considered judicial deposits for the purposes of the Act
respecting deposits with the Bureau général de dépôts pour le Québec (chapter D-5.1).

criterion of integration and insertion into a built environment.
156. The city may, by by-law, prescribe, for all or part of its territory and according to the classes it

157. The city may, by by-law,

belonging to the owners who are parties to the agreement represent, according to the property assessment roll,

162. The city may, by by-law,
(1) specify the requirements respecting fences and hedges, namely:
(a) their distance from public roads;
(b) their maximum and minimum height;
(c) the places where they may or must be located;
(d) the material they are made of;
(e) the manner in which they must be made; and
(f) their maintenance according to preservation and architecture requirements;
(2) provide for the bringing into compliance of fences and hedges, for their removal and, if necessary, the

(3) provide, in case of failure to comply with any public safety requirement of the by-law, whether the
offender refuses or fails to comply or cannot be found, for such fences or hedges to be corrected, removed or
installed by the city at the expense of the offender; the expense constitutes a prior claim on the immovable
concerned, of the same nature and with the same rank as the claims referred to in paragraph 5 of article 2651
of the Civil Code; the expense is secured by a legal hypothec on the immovable.
162.1. Subparagraph 3 of the second paragraph of section 532 of the Act respecting elections and
referendums in municipalities (chapter E-2.2) does not apply to a by-law referred to in section 136.0.1 or

163. A borough council shall, in respect of the part of the territory of the former Ville de Montréal situated
within its territorial boundaries, pass, before 31 March 2002, a zoning by-law that renews the provisions of
the Urban Planning By-law of the former Ville de Montréal (R.B.C.M., c U-1).
The second sentence of the second paragraph and the third and fourth paragraphs of section 126, the second
paragraph of section 127, sections 128 to 133, the second and third paragraphs of section 134 and sections
135 to 137 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1) do not apply to a by-
law passed by a borough council under the first paragraph.
A by-law passed under the first paragraph is deemed to comply with the land use planning and development
plan of the city notwithstanding the absence of a certificate of compliance.
164. Until a borough council passes the by-law provided for in section 163, the Urban Planning By-law of
the former Ville de Montréal (R.B.C.M., c. U-1) applies, with respect to the part of the territory of the former
Ville de Montréal situated within the territorial boundaries of the borough, adapted as follows:
(1) for the purposes of section 113 and of Division V of Chapter III of the Act respecting land use planning
and development (chapter A-19.1), each zone is the territorial unit resulting from the spatial overlapping of all
the plans attached to the Urban Planning By-law of the former Ville de Montréal;
(2) a provision of that By-law related to the approval, prior to the issue of a building permit or an alteration
permit, of plans related to the development, architecture and design of constructions or to the development of
land and work related thereto shall be, with respect to any permit that must be issued as of 1 January 2002,
deemed to constitute a provision subjecting the issue of a building permit for the project covered by the By-
law to the approval of plans related to the site planning and the architecture of constructions or the
development of the land, and work related thereto, within the meaning of sections 145.16 to 145.20.1 of the
Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1).
165. Sections 163 and 164 do not apply if the former Ville de Montréal passed, before 31 December 2001,
a by-law referred to in the first paragraph of section 163.
166. Where a notice of motion has been given with a view to passing or amending a by-law referred to in
section 89 of this Act, no building plan may be approved nor may any permit or certificate be granted for the

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
carrying out of work or use of an immovable that, if the by-law that is the subject of the notice of motion is
adopted, will be prohibited in the zone concerned.
167. The second sentence of the second paragraph and the third and fourth paragraphs of section 126, the
second paragraph of section 127, sections 128 to 133, the second and third paragraphs of section 134 and
sections 135 to 137 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1) do not apply to
a by-law passed by a borough council in order to replace its zoning or subdivision by-laws by a new zoning
by-law or a new subdivision by-law that applies to the whole territory of the borough, provided that such a
by-law comes into force within three years of 14 November 2001.
Such a by-law must be approved, in accordance with the Act respecting elections and referendums in
municipalities (chapter E-2.2), by the qualified voters of the whole territory of the borough.
The borough council may avail itself of this section only once for each by-law.
Until a new zoning by-law is passed under this section, in a borough comprising part of the territory of the
former Ville de Montréal, other than the Mont-Royal Borough, every zone or, where applicable, every sector
of a zone whose perimeter is situated, in whole or in part, less than 200 m from the limits of the zone covered
by the proposed by-law is deemed to be a zone or a contiguous sector for the purposes of section 113 and
Division V of Chapter III of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1). This
paragraph will cease to have effect three years after 14 November 2001.
168. Notwithstanding section 200 of this Act, the authorizations granted under item b .1 of subparagraph 2
of the first paragraph of article 524 and article 649a of the Charter of the City of Montréal (1959-1960, c.
102) and the by-laws passed under item d of subparagraph 2 of the first paragraph of article 524 and article
612a of that Charter shall remain valid and continue to have effect in accordance with those authorizations or
by-laws.
For the purposes of a by-law passed under article 612a of that Charter, a provision of that by-law related to
approval, prior to the issue of a building permit or an alteration permit, of plans related to the development of
land and work related thereto shall be, with respect to any permit that must be issued, deemed to constitute a
provision subjecting the issue of those permits to the approval of plans related to the site planning and the
architecture of constructions within the meaning of sections 145.16 to 145.20.1 of the Act respecting land use
planning and development (chapter A-19.1).
169. The borough council shall exercise the powers of the city, provided for in sections 148.0.1 to
148.0.24 of the Act respecting land use planning and development (chapter A-19.1), on the demolition of
immovables. In addition, it shall exercise the powers of the city provided for in sections 64, 65, 72, 77, 155 to
157 and 162 of this Schedule.
However, the functions assigned by the Act respecting land use planning and development to the committee
established under section 148.0.3 of that Act shall be exercised by the advisory planning committee
established under section 132 of this Charter. The sittings of the committee held for such purpose are public.
170. The borough council may, by resolution, decide to continue the procedure for the passage of a
proposed by-law to amend an urban planning by-law that comes under its jurisdiction if the proposed by-law
was passed before 31 December 2001 and is not in force on that date.
171. All kinds of constructions shall be prohibited on the south side of Boulevard Saint-Joseph, bordering
Lac Saint-Louis, between 34e Avenue and the western boundaries of the former Ville de Lachine.
However, the first paragraph does not prevent the city from installing the Monument aux braves de Lachine
on the property of Stoney Point Park.

previous date decided between themselves, the tower now standing in Mount Royal Park shall be demolished

AWARD OF CONTRACTS
198. (Repealed).
199. Notwithstanding sections 573, 573.1 and 573.3.0.2 of the Cities and Towns Act (chapter C-19), the
mayor or, if he or she is absent or unable to act, the chair of the executive committee or, if he or she is also

All underground conduits, whether they were built in the public domain or on private property, by the
commission, the city or a third party, shall be under the jurisdiction of the commission.
204.1. If a reconstituted municipality of the urban agglomeration of Montréal manifests, by a resolution of
its council, its intention to transfer responsibility to the commission for any existing or proposed underground
conduit situated in its territory, the commission may, by resolution, accept that responsibility.
On the date the commission adopts its resolution accepting the transfer, the city becomes the owner of the
existing underground conduits covered by the resolution of the council of the reconstituted municipality. The

building to an existing conduit.
Once the conduits described in this section have been built or in order to build them, the commission shall
exercise the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by this chapter, with the necessary modifications. The
commission is not, however, authorized to extend such conduits, except to connect a building to them.
In addition, with the owner’s consent and to ensure that those conduits are fully functional, the commission
may carry out any operation on an adjacent installation.
205. The city or any other interested party may appeal, before the Commission municipale du Québec, any
rule, decision or act of the commission or of the city, in any matter relating to underground conduits, except in
contractual matters where the parties have agreed to renounce that appeal.
The appeal must, under pain of forfeiture, be brought within 30 days after the date of notification to the
interested party or of publication of a notice indicating the rule, decision or act covered by the appeal.
The appeal is made by means of a registration filed with the Commission municipale du Québec; the
appellant shall notify a notice of that appeal to the opposing party or the party’s attorney.
206. Where the commission builds an underground conduit, it may order, by notice, any owner of cables
(1) to state to it which portion of those conduits it wishes to reserve; and
(2) to identify the cables that belong to it and replace the overhead cables with underground cables placed in
that conduit.
Should an owner fail to comply with the notice referred to in the first paragraph within the prescribed time
limit, the commission may apply to the Commission municipale du Québec for the execution of an order
given in the notice.
207. The underground conduits must be built so that
(1) each user has a separate opening or separate compartment in the opening where practicable; and
(2) the part where the telecommunication cables are placed is separated from the part where the lighting and
power cables are placed by a wall made of non-flammable and non-conductive material.

of the plans and specifications.

the location of the proposed support structures.
The commission shall determine the manner in which underground conduits and overhead constructions are to
be linked to distribution networks and to buildings.

be awarded an indemnity comprising the actual value, at that time, of the material and the cost of installation
work.
Where there is an indemnity, the removed material shall constitute expropriated property belonging to the city.
211. Where the city or the commission decides to construct underground conduits in streets, lanes, parks or
public places, the city or, as the case may be, the commission on behalf of the city, shall take over the private
underground conduits therein and pay a reasonable indemnity for those conduits and for the material that has
become useless.
Upon payment of that indemnity, the underground conduits and all the removed material shall constitute
expropriated property belonging to the city.
212. The indemnities covered by sections 210 and 211 of this Chapter shall be fixed by the commission.

cost of the work charged to him or her.
If the owner refuses or fails to make the deposit, the commission may nevertheless proceed with the work,
and a certificate from the commission attesting to the cost of the work shall be sent to the treasurer.
The treasurer shall enter the amount specified on the commission’s certificate on the property tax collection
roll of the year under way for the defaulting owner’s immovable. The cost of the work thus charged to the
owner shall constitute a property tax encumbering that immovable in favour of the city.
214. Where the commission alters underground conduits or overhead constructions at the request of the
city or a third party, it may, at its discretion, charge the alteration work to the city or to the third party
applicant, where applicable, and demand an advance deposit sufficient to guarantee the payment thereof.
215. The commission is authorized to enter, without the owner’s consent, any private property for the
purposes of installing overhead or underground cables and their accessories.
An indemnity, determined by the commission, shall be paid for any actual damage caused by the work

constructions.
The commission shall fix the amount of those payments annually, so as to cover
(1) the administration and maintenance cost of the conduits and constructions;

TECHNOPARC SAINT-LAURENT
232. The city may, by by-law, acquire, by agreement or expropriation, any immovable situated in the
territory described in the second paragraph for the purposes of alienating it in favour of Technoparc Saint-
Laurent for the establishment of a high technology park.
The territory referred to in the first paragraph shall be established pursuant to the Schedule to chapter 69 of
the Statutes of 1992 respecting Technoparc Saint-Laurent which continues to apply for that purpose.
233. All appropriations referred to in the acquisition by-law must derive from the general fund of the city.
Before the by-law provided for in section 232 is passed, Technoparc Saint-Laurent shall provide the city with
an amount of money or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank, a financial services cooperative or a
trust company, for an amount equal to the amount established by the expropriation by-law.
The by-law provided for in section 232 must indicate the amount referred to in the preceding paragraph or
indicate that the irrevocable letter of credit has been received.
234. The city shall become the owner of an expropriated immovable from the day of registration in the
land register of the notice of expropriation together with
Updated to N1ovember 10 2024

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
(1) proof establishing that the provisional indemnity has been paid to the expropriated party or deposited, on
his or her behalf, at the office of the Superior Court; and
(2) proof of the service on the expropriated party of the notice of expropriation.
The notice of expropriation must be accompanied by the text of this section regarding the immediate transfer
of title.
235. The city’s offer may not exceed the standardized value of the immovable.
The provisional indemnity of the expropriated party shall be equal to 90% of the city’s offer.
The provisional indemnity for a lessee or occupant in good faith, even if he or she operates a business or an
industry, shall be equal to three months’ rent.
In the case of a commercial or industrial operation, the provisional indemnity shall include an amount equal to
25% of the rental value entered on the roll of rental values.
The period during which an expropriated party may remain in possession of the expropriated immovable may
not exceed three months from the date of notification of the notice of expropriation.
The period during which a lessee or occupant in good faith may remain in possession of the immovable may
not exceed three months from the date of service of a notice to that effect.
The city may take possession of the immovable only after paying the provisional indemnity to the lessee or
occupant in good faith or depositing the amount at the office of the Superior Court.
236. Once the city has become the owner of an immovable under section 234, the city may alienate it to
Technoparc Saint-Laurent.
Technoparc Saint-Laurent must pay the city an amount equal to the difference between the city’s offer and the
final indemnity granted by the court of last instance or fixed after agreement between the parties to the
expropriation proceedings, and the interest and costs.
The amount must be paid within 60 days after notice to that effect is served on Technoparc Saint-Laurent by
the city.
The agreement referred to in the second paragraph must be authorized by Technoparc Saint-Laurent.
237. The amount corresponding to the difference between the city’s offer and the final indemnity as well
as the interest and other costs shall be, from 1 January 1994, deemed to be a property tax secured by a prior
claim constituting a real right, on all movable and immovable property of Technoparc Saint-Laurent.
The city may renounce all or part of the prior claim in respect of the property affected by the prior claim.
238. Technoparc Saint-Laurent may, with the city’s authorization, alienate any immovable acquired under
section 236, for the purpose of establishing a high technology park or for related purposes, even if the
payment referred to in section 236 has not yet been made.

use it for municipal purposes.
240. For the purposes of sections 232 to 239, the city is not subject to the Act respecting municipal
industrial immovables (chapter I-0.1).
Updated to N1ovember 10 2024

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
241. Sections 232 to 239 have effect notwithstanding the Act to preserve agricultural land and agricultural
activities (chapter P-41.1).
Where the city acquires, by expropriation, an immovable situated in an agricultural zone, the owner of the
immovable may, within 30 days after the notice of expropriation is served, exclude the immovable from the
agricultural zone by filing a notice to that effect with the Land Registry Office. A copy of that notice shall be
notified to the Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Québec and on the city.
Filing the notice with the Land Registry Office shall have the same effect as a decision of the Commission
excluding the immovable from the agricultural zone at the request of the owner.
For the purposes of establishing the expropriation indemnity, the immovable shall be considered never to have
been included in the agricultural zone.
242. Subject to sections 234 and 235, the Act respecting expropriation (chapter E-25) applies to
expropriations made under this Charter.
243. The city may, by by-law, allow Technoparc Saint-Laurent, in respect of the first year or the first two
years of repayment of a loan by-law, to spread over several fiscal years the payment of taxes connected with
municipal work.
Deferred taxes, with accrued interest, shall be payable in a maximum of three equal annual payments over a
maximum of five successive fiscal years, including the years for which the taxes have been deferred.
244. Technoparc Saint-Laurent is deemed to renounce the spreading of its tax payments if it fails to pay
the payable portion of the tax to which the by-law respecting such spreading of payment applies for the fiscal
year considered or if it pays the total amount of taxes.
245. The privilege attached to a tax to which the by-law respecting the spreading of tax payment applies
encumbers the immovable included in the unit of assessment to guarantee the payment of the deferred amount
and the interest accrued thereon as soon as Technoparc Saint-Laurent avails itself of the right to spread the
payment of its taxes.
246. Any tax amount the payment of which is deferred to a subsequent fiscal year shall bear interest at the
rate fixed by the by-law.
The rate, when fixed, must not be higher than the rate applied by the city to property tax arrears.
In no case may the rate be changed for any part of the fiscal year; each successive rate shall be valid for a
whole fiscal year.
247. The prescription period for tax arrears shall run only from the dates on which the payments provided
for in the by-law passed under section 243 are payable.
248. Notwithstanding section 243, the balance remaining on any deferred taxes, with accrued interest,
shall be payable by Technoparc Saint-Laurent where it transfers the immovable included in the unit of
assessment on which the tax was imposed before the time limit prescribed in that section or in the by-law. The
balance must be paid in a single payment. It shall be payable at the expiry of the time limit prescribed by
section 252 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1) or under that section.
The city may send an account to Technoparc Saint-Laurent after the roll is amended following the transfer of
the immovable included in the unit of assessment. The account shall show the principal and the interest
separately.
The application of this section does not affect the privilege guaranteeing payment of the balance referred to in
the first paragraph.
Updated to N1ovember 10 2024

CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTRÉAL
249. Technoparc Saint-Laurent may, at any time, pay all or part of any deferred payment of an amount,
with accrued interest, before it becomes payable.
In case of partial payment, it shall first be applied to the interest. Sections 246 to 248 apply to the balance.
250. The city may, by by-law, adopt a program for the purpose of granting a tax credit related to the setting
up or expansion of a high technology establishment in the territory established pursuant to the Schedule to
chapter 95 of the Statutes of 1999 respecting Technoparc Saint-Laurent, which continues to apply, subject to
the terms and conditions determined in the by-law.
For the purposes of this section, “high technology” refers in particular to the aerospace, telecommunications,
biotechnology, pharmacology, computer, electronics, microelectronics, optoelectronics, robotics, optics and
laser fields. “High technology” means a use having as its main activity
(1) scientific or technological research or development;
(2) scientific or technological training;
(3) the administration of a technological enterprise; or
(4) the manufacturing of technological products, including scientific research and experimental development.
A by-law passed under this section may not provide for a tax credit for a period exceeding five years; the
eligibility period for the program may not extend beyond 31 December 2008.
The effect of the tax credit shall be to offset any increase in property taxes that may result from reassessment
of the immovables after completion of the work. For the fiscal year in which the work is completed and for
the next two fiscal years, the amount of the tax credit shall be the difference between the amount of the
property taxes that would have been payable if the assessment of the immovables had not been changed and
the amount of the property taxes actually payable. For the next two fiscal years, the amount of the tax credit
shall be, respectively, 80% and 60% of the amount of the tax credit for the first fiscal year.
The by-law provided for in the first paragraph may only be passed and, where applicable, only applies if the
city’s zoning by-law provides that in the case of the main activities referred to in subparagraphs 1 and 4 of the
second paragraph, the use must occupy a gross floor area reserved and intended for scientific research and
experimental development that is equal to at least 15% of the total gross floor area occupied or intended to be
occupied for that use. The zoning by-law must also provide that no use having as its main activity one of the
activities referred to in subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the second paragraph may be authorized for more than 30%
of the territory referred to in the first paragraph of section 250.
251. For the purposes of the levy of municipal property tax based on the value of the immovables, vacant
land forming part of the territory referred to in the first paragraph of section 250 and owned by Technoparc
Saint-Laurent is deemed to be an immovable belonging to a mandatary of the city within the meaning of
paragraph 5 of section 204 of the Act respecting municipal taxation (chapter F-2.1).
252. No illegality or irregularity may result from the fact that, before 1 January 1999, the former Ville de
Saint-Laurent passed and applied By-law 1160 or became surety for or subsidized Technoparc Saint-Laurent.
253. Sections 251 and 252 and any by-law passed under section 250 have effect from 1 January 1999.
253.1. Notwithstanding section 8, the expenditures relating to payment of a final expropriation indemnity
by the city within the framework of an expropriation begun before 1 January 2002 under the Act respecting
the city of Saint-Laurent (1992, chapter 69) shall be financed by the revenues derived exclusively from the
territory of Ville de Saint-Laurent instead of solely from the part of that territory determined under section 9
of that Act.

MUNICIPAL COURT
254. The Municipal Court may, in any action or suit brought before it against a permit or a licence holder,
suspend for a period it determines or cancel any licence or permit granted under a municipal by-law, for
misconduct, incompetence, or violation of an act or such a by-law.
CHAPTER VIII
PENAL PROCEEDINGS
255. Where a municipal by-law requiring a licence or permit provides for a fine or other penalty for
infringement, the city may institute penal proceedings and, for recovering the tax that is the object of the
licence or permit, institute civil proceedings, even when the name of the defendant is not entered on any
assessment, rental value or collection roll.
255.1. The filing of a document of the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec containing
information relating to the identity of the owner of a vehicle the registration number of which is indicated on
the statement of offence, whether the document is transmitted by the Société or obtained with its authorization
in accordance with law, constitutes, failing any evidence to the contrary, proof of the identity of the owner of
the vehicle in penal proceedings instituted before the municipal court for an offence against a provision of a
traffic by-law, a motor vehicle parking by-law or a by-law respecting the use of a motor vehicle or its
accessories, or for any offence against a provision of the Highway Safety Code (chapter C-24.2), the
Transport Act (chapter T-12) or a regulation under any of those Acts.
To be admissible as evidence, the document need only bear the attestation of an employee of the city to the
effect that the document emanates from the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec.
CHAPTER IX
CIVIL REMEDIES AGAINST THE MUNICIPALITY
256. The city shall have the right to have its investigators or experts examine, at any time before the
institution of an action, between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., movable and immovable property which is the
subject of a claim resulting from flooding. No claimant who refuses, without valid reason, to allow such
examination may exercise his or her right of action as long as such refusal continues.
In the case of a claim for damage to perishables, the claimant shall notify the city by registered mail that he or
she will hold those perishables at its disposal for examination for the next 72 hours, and he or she may not,
without a reasonable excuse, dispose of them before the expiry of such time, on pain of forfeiting his right of
action.
257. No action against the city for damages shall be admissible for damage resulting from the flooding of
an immovable built after 28 April 1939, unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that at the time of the flooding
safety valves in good working order had been installed according to accepted practice, to prevent back-flow
from city sewers into the cellars or the basement of that immovable.
The city may, by by-law, require that a building be equipped with an automatic lift-pump system in the cases
and on the conditions it determines, and no action against the city for damages shall then be admissible for
damage resulting from flooding in a building to which such requirement applies, unless the plaintiff alleges
and proves that at the time of the flooding a pumping system had been installed and was in operation in
accordance with the by-law.
258. The city shall not be required to give security in order to appeal a judgment or make an order, or to
institute a civil action or civil proceeding.

laws or regulations, the city is exempted, up to an annual amount of $800,000, from the payment of
registration fees for motor vehicles belonging to it that it uses for municipal purposes.
268. Any peace officer or any other person authorized to issue a statement of offence for an offence related
to traffic, parking of a motor vehicle or the use of a motor vehicle may move any vehicle parked in
contravention of a traffic or parking by-law, regulation, order or resolution, or have it moved by a service
vehicle or tow truck.
The statement of offence shall mention that the vehicle was moved and indicate the additional costs or
amounts, determined by by-law, that may be collected as a result of its being moved. The latter shall be added
to the amounts that may be claimed from the defendant by the prosecutor in the statement of offence. The
additional costs or amounts that may be claimed because a vehicle was moved shall be collected by the
collector in accordance with articles 321, 322 and 327 to 331 of the Code of Penal Procedure (chapter C-25.1)
or the provisions of this Act.
In every case provided for in this section, the city may, by by-law, assign to the head of the competent
department, or to any other officer or employee designated by the latter, the exercise of all the powers and
duties assigned by this section to the peace officer or person authorized under the first paragraph to issue a
statement of offence.
269. (Repealed).
270. The city may enter into an agreement with the Gouvernement du Québec and the Government of
Canada respecting the operation of the La Ronde amusement park after the Universal Exhibition of 1967, and
to perform the acts it may deem useful to give it effect.
The agreement may provide for the constitution of a legal person and any other conditions as may be accepted
by the council.
The city may acquire the installations at the La Ronde amusement park.
271. The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy may, at the request of the executive
committee, extend a time period prescribed for the city in this Act. Where the Minister considers it expedient,
the Minister may extend the period again on the conditions the Minister determines.
272. The agreements entered into on 29 June 1982 and 1 October 1982, respectively, between the
Commission de transport of the Communauté urbaine de Montréal and Canadian National Railways, in the
first case, and Canadian Pacific Limited, in the other case, in respect of the commuter train service between
Montréal and Deux-Montagnes and that between Montréal and Rigaud, respectively, are deemed to have been
validly entered into by the Commission and no action to contest the validity of the agreements is admissible
on the grounds that the Commission was not authorized to enter into them.
273. The restrictions respecting land use encumbering the lots described in the deeds of transfer and sale
made in favour of Ville d’Anjou by Champlain Heights Ltd. or Metropolitan Shopping Centre Ltd., hereafter
listed, are hereby abolished and dissolved, and any personal obligation or real right arising from such
restrictions respecting land use is hereby declared terminated. The deeds of transfer and deeds of sale in
question have been registered in the registry office of the registration division of Montréal under numbers
1,209,636, 1,340,535, 1,421,918, 1,528,976, 1,679,075, 1,679,076, 1,954,570 and 1,954,571.
274. The city shall exercise all the powers that may be delegated to a body under section 212 of the Act
respecting remunerated passenger transportation by automobile (chapter T-11.2).
275. In the case of a subsequent offence, payment by the defendant of the amount claimed in a statement
of offence indicating the name of the same defendant and the same address constitutes prima facie proof of
the defendant’s previous conviction without it being necessary to prove his or her identity.
